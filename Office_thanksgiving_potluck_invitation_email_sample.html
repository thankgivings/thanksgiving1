        <h2><strong>Office thanksgiving potluck invitation email sample Art buchwald explaining thanksgiving french</strong></h2>
        <p>In 1838, Lower <b>Canada</b> used <b>Thanksgiving</b> to <b>celebrate</b> the end of the Lower <b>Canada</b> Rebellion. [24] Following the rebellions, the two Canadas were merged into a united Province of <b>Canada</b>, which observed <b>Thanksgiving</b> six times from 1850 to 1865. [24] During this period, <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a solemn, mid-week celebration. [26]  The first &lsquo;national&rsquo; observance of <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b> was celebrated in the Province of <b>Canada</b> in 1859 and was organized by the Protestant clergy who seemingly appropriated the American <b>Thanksgiving</b>, first observed in the states in 1777 and they established a national <b>day</b> of &ldquo;public <b>thanksgiving</b> and prayer&rdquo; in 1789.  Just like in America, Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is an opportunity for family to gather and <b>celebrate</b> the harvest. It is thought that one reason for the timing of Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> being so much earlier than American <b>Thanksgiving</b> is because <b>Canada</b> is further north, and they <b>celebrate</b> the Fall Harvest earlier in the year.  The first official <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>day</b> in <b>Canada</b> on record came after confederation on April 15 1872 to <b>celebrate</b> the recovery of the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) from a serious illness. By 1879, <b>Thanksgiving</b> was declared an official Canadian national holiday, though its precise date shifted between November and October for years to come.  Origins and Significance. <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b> originated purely as a harvest festival. On January 31, 1957, the Canadian Parliament proclaimed: A <b>Day</b> of General <b>Thanksgiving</b> to Almighty God for the bountiful harvest with which <b>Canada</b> has been blessed &ndash; to be observed on the 2nd Monday in October.  The <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>we</b> know today, falling on the second Monday in October, only became official in 1957. Good memories of holidays often stem from meals and time spent with friends and family.  Aside from the problematic story about the pilgrims ‚Å† and the Wampanoag, <b>Thanksgiving</b> as <b>we</b> know it, did not become a holiday until the middle of the nineteenth century. For all intents and purposes, <b>Thanksgiving</b>, as <b>we</b> understand it, was invented by Sarah Josepha Hale, the editor of Godey&rsquo;s Lady Book, a popular magazine of the era. As ...  The citizens of Halifax commemorated the end of the Seven Years&rsquo; War in 1763 with a <b>day</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, and Loyalists subsequently brought the celebration to other parts of the country. When and why has <b>Thanksgiving</b> been observed in <b>Canada</b>? The first national <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b> was celebrated in the Province of <b>Canada</b> in 1859. It was ...  Traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner with roasted turkey, side dishes, and pumpkin pie. <b>Thanksgiving</b> Feast. Families usually <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> with neighbours and family friends. The <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast is the main event that takes place during the holiday.
