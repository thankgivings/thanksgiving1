        <h2><strong>Great side dish for thanksgiving Best thanksgiving recipes sides</strong></h2>
        <p>In this Wampanoag <b>story</b> told in a Native tradition, two kids from the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe learn the <b>story</b> of Wee&acirc;chumun (<b>corn</b>) and the first Thanksgiving. Written and illustrated by four Indigenous creators, this picture book for 3-7-year-olds is about the first Thanksgiving from a Native American perspective.  Food was so scarce that most days the Pilgrims only had a daily ration of 5 kernels of <b>corn</b> apiece. How did they survive this hardship? By giving in to bitterness and despair?  This <b>story</b> weaves its way through Thanksgiving history and has become a beautiful way to help us count our blessings. In our home, we set out five kernels of <b>corn</b> at each place around the table, sharing the <b>story</b> passed down through generations.  The <b>story </b>goes that once <b>Thanksgiving </b>became a holiday, the Pilgrims would start their meal with five kernels of <b>corn </b>on their plate. These five golden kernels represented all the pilgrims had to eat for the entire day during difficult winter.  Today I want to share with you a fun and simple Thanksgiving tradition that I love, the Legend of the Five Kernels of <b>Corn</b>. This Thanksgiving tradition is a wonderful gratitude activity to recognize how much you have and how blessed you are each year during the holidays.  Many people follow a tradition of placing five kernels of <b>corn</b> on the empty plate at each place on the Thanksgiving dinner table. These five kernels of corn serve as a reminder of days when food was scarce and how God provides for our needs.  My Mom started the Thanksgiving tradition of 5 kernels of <b>corn</b> many years ago when a student gave her a bag of candy corns with the following text attached. From that time on, we have had 5 candy corns on our dinner plate each Thanksgiving.  At a <b>Thanksgiving </b>celebration that fall, the first course was different: An empty plate with 5 kernels of <b>corn </b>was placed before each person. The pilgrims stood up one by one and shared five things for which they were thankful.  From then on, when they celebrated Thanksgiving, the <b>Pilgrims</b> laid out five kernels of corn on each plate to remind themselves of their blessings. Let us remember: The first kernel reminds us of the autumn beauty all around us. </p>        <p>Thank you letter sample for interview. Why thanksgiving football game.
