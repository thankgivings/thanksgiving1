Every November, Americans gather around the table to celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> in ...  The new resource, The &ldquo;<b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo;: How Can We Tell a Better <b>Story</b>?, is an Inquiry Design Model-based resource designed for grades 3&ndash;5 that helps teachers and students dispel misconceptions about the &ldquo;<b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; by examining key details and events through multiple perspectives, including those of the Wampanoag nation ...

It was not even the <b>first</b> national <b>Thanksgiving</b> &ndash; which was held on Dec. 18, 1777, at then-General ...  The <b>story</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b> says that the Indians met and helped the colonists in April, 1621. They gave the colonists food and taught them how to plant corn and catch fish.
