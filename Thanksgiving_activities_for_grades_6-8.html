        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving activities for grades 6-8 Iup thanksgiving break</strong></h2>
        <p>After <b>Thanksgiving</b> meals come Black Friday <b>sales</b>. But do you really know the meaning and history behind the name &quot;Black Friday&quot;? Learn about it here.  Black Friday is a term commonly used to refer to the Friday after <b>Thanksgiving</b>, when retailers have traditionally kicked off the holiday shopping season with deep discounts.  The <b>term</b> Black Friday was first used to describe the Friday after Thanksgiving in 1951. Factory Management and Maintenance magazine complained of retail employees calling in sick that day to extend their vacations.  Linking pre-<b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>sales</b> with Black Friday is also a marketing technique since it&rsquo;s a name consumers recognize and associate with big, limited-time bargains, Zhang said. Multiple post-<b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>sales</b> events keep shoppers enticed after Black Friday, including Small Business Saturday and Cyber Monday, which the National Retail ...  <b>History</b> of Black Friday: From Financial Crash to Shopping Mania: Photos. Black Friday has not always been about crowds shopping for <b>sales</b> at obscenely early hours the day after Thanksgiving.  Black Friday wouldn&rsquo;t be tied to post-<b>Thanksgiving</b> shopping until the late 1950s, when Philadelphia police gave the derisive nickname to the flood of rowdy tourists that descended on the city...  In the early <b>1960s</b>, Kleger and I put together a front-page story for Thanksgiving and we appropriated the police term &ldquo;Black Friday&rdquo; to describe the terrible traffic conditions. However, local police weren&rsquo;t the only ones who loathed this day.  Black Friday <b>is</b> the Friday after Thanksgiving in the United States. It traditionally marks the start of the Christmas shopping season and is the busiest shopping day of the year in the United States. Many stores offer highly promoted sales at discounted prices and often open early, sometimes as early as midnight [2] or even on Thanksgiving.  The phrase&rsquo;s use in relation to shopping the day after Thanksgiving, however, is most often traced <b>to</b> Philadelphia <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid</b>-<b>20th</b> <b>century</b> &mdash; when police and other city workers had to deal with large crowds who collected before the annual Army-Navy game and to take advantage of seasonal sales. </p>        <p>Historia del thanksgiving day en ingles para ninos.
