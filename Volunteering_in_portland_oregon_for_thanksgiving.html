        <p>In our family, no one is big on roasted turkey. We&rsquo;re just not fans of &ldquo;white meat&rdquo; overall, and turkey with its huge breast is mostly white meat. So, whenever we celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> at home, we prefer to roast some other kind of poultry: Cornish game hens, duck or, best of all, <b>goose</b>. When it comes to dark meat, nothing can beat <b>goose</b>!  No more rubbery, yucky <b>goose</b> skin full of fat! I have made a <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>goose</b> every year for at least 15 years. I have steadily gained on making the perfect bird but I finally found the greatest recipe ever in Cook&#39;s Magazine.  In this article, we&rsquo;ll explore over 50 <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>goose</b> recipes that range from classic preparations to innovative twists, ensuring that your holiday meal is both memorable and delicious.  Many years ago our family moved to serving roast <b>goose</b> for Christmas in lieu of a repeating Turkey on the heels of Thanksgiving. I used a recipe very similar to the one here, but brushed the...  This slow roast <b>goose</b> recipe yields extra juicy meat with crispy skin. It&rsquo;s a perfect dish for your <b>Thanksgiving</b> or Christmas dinner, which you can make in advance with minimal hands-on time. I&rsquo;ve had three Thanksgiving since moving to the US.  With my method, you roast the <b>goose</b> for a while, then slice off the whole breast and finish it in a pan once the legs are done. That way you still get a nice roasted flavor on the whole <b>goose</b>, and you get crispy skin and you get properly pink breast meat.  Learn how to roast a <b>goose</b> from legendary chef Jacques P&eacute;pin, who shares one of his favorite <b>goose</b> recipes for achieving irresistibly crispy skin and juicy meat.  Generously sprinkle the outside of the <b>goose</b> with salt and pepper, and place it, breast-side up on a wire rack set in a large roasting pan. Roast <b>goose</b> in the oven until it turns a golden brown, about 1 hour.  Roast <b>goose</b> is a most historic fare for a holiday dinner. (Remember that scene from Charles Dickens&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Christmas Carol&rdquo;?) For an old-fashioned feast, here&rsquo;s a recipe for how to roast a <b>goose</b>. Most grocers can supply a frozen goose anytime; fresh birds are usually available during the holidays. </p>        <p>Kids thanksgiving free printable crafts. <strong>Volunteering in portland oregon for thanksgiving</strong>.
