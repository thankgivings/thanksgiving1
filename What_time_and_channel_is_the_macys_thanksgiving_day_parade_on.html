        <h2><strong>What time and channel is the macys thanksgiving day parade on Thanksgiving jones soda</strong></h2>
        <p>Days of thanksgiving, that is, days set aside to give thanks to God, have been common in Christendom for hundreds of years and long predate the European colonization of North America. Documented thanksgiving services in what is currently the United States were conducted as early as the <b>16th</b> <b>century</b> by the Spaniards [ 5 ] [ 6 ] and the French. [ 7 ]  According to the Texas Society Daughters of the American Colonists, the very first thanksgiving was observed by Spanish <b>explorer</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>Vasquez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Coronado</b>. Accompanied by 1,500 men in...  The story behind Thanksgiving starts in <b>1620</b> when a group of Protestants, who had left their native England after they were persecuted for their religion there, landed in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  The first Thanksgiving service known to be held by Europeans in North America occurred <b>on</b> <b>May</b> <b>27</b>, <b>1578</b>, in Newfoundland, although earlier Church-type services were probably held by Spaniards in La Florida.  The first Thanksgiving was a harvest celebration held by the pilgrims of <b>Plymouth</b> colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first Thanksgiving. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written.  Although there is evidence of earlier <b>thanksgiving</b> celebrations in the Americas by the Spanish in the 16th century and at the Jamestown Colony of Virginia in 1610, following what is known as the &ldquo;starving times&rdquo; of 1609, these are not recognized as the &ldquo;<b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo;, a term coined by the editor Alexander Young in 1841 referring ...  Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the first recorded religious Thanksgiving Day in Plymouth happened two years later in <b>1623</b>. On this occasion, the...  But some historians argue that Florida, not Massachusetts, may have been the true site of the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>in North</b> <b>America</b>. In 1565, nearly 60 <b>years</b> before Plymouth, a Spanish...  According to one historian, this was the &ldquo;first community act of religion and thanksgiving&rdquo; by Europeans in North America. 8 This <b>1919</b> postcard depicts the first mass celebrated at <b>Saint</b> Augustine. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving activity for pre-k kids.
