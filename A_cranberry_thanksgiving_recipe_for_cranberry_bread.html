        <p>Prisoners can find their way to thankfulness&mdash;even in a cell. And like Sean, many are already looking for ways to pay forward the blessings they have received. This <b>Thanksgiving</b>, you can bless a man or woman behind bars with a reason to give thanks&mdash;and learn more about how lives are changing every day. <b>REMEMBER</b> THE PRISONER  If you have a loved one incarcerated, I want to know the warmth and joy that can be found even in an institutional setting. More importantly, for those people with <b>prison</b> on the horizon I want...  A few years later, I got arrested with a Tupperware full of heroin, and I was stone cold sober for my first <b>Thanksgiving in pr</b>ison. That was in 2011, a few months after a judge sentenced me to 2.5 years behind bars for felony drug possession.  I was born on Thanksgiving. My family would gather at my grandparents&rsquo; farm. I remember <b>Grandma</b> in the grand kitchen cooking, baking, and fluttering around creating memorable smells. There was always a dish of olives for us to put on each finger like tentacles.  <b>Prison</b> <b>chaplains</b> often hold special religious services over Thanksgiving that aim to lift the spirits and remind those incarcerated that they are not forgotten. Inmates can also correspond with relatives to share messages of gratitude and support.  <b>Remember</b> <b>those</b> <b>who are</b> in <b>prison</b> The phrase &quot;<b>Remember</b> <b>those</b> <b>who are</b> in <b>prison</b>&quot; calls believers to a profound sense of empathy and solidarity with <b>those</b> who are incarcerated. The Greek word for &quot;<b>remember</b>&quot; is &quot;mnemoneuete,&quot; which implies an active, ongoing mindfulness rather than a passive recollection.  On Nov. 16, 1958, The Independent-Journal featured a story on the efforts of San Quentin&rsquo;s incarcerated kitchen crew preparing a <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast. &ldquo;Kitchen helpers today began the herculean job of slicing meat off 190 turkeys, fare for tomorrow&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner at San Quentin State <b>Prison</b>,&rdquo; reported the newspaper.  Last year we were thankful for each day when we called home and were told that <b>those</b> we loved were healthy and alive. &ldquo;One day at a time&rdquo; took on a whole new and often desperate sense of meaning. In <b>prison</b> this phrase is gospel because at any time things can go wrong.  Daniel <b>Genis</b> and fellow inmates observe Thanksgiving with a turkey in prison in 2008. Daniel Genis&#39; Thanksgiving dinner specialty was always fried mackerel. Not the most traditional dish, to be sure, but nor were the circumstances traditional: he was celebrating the holiday in prison. </p>        <p>Adam sandler singing happy thanksgiving.
