        <h2><strong>How long was the 1st thanksgiving Droid thanksgiving live wallpaper</strong></h2>
        <p>The holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> may have secular origins, but themes of gratitude and <b>thanksgiving</b> permeate the <b>Bible</b>. If you&rsquo;re short on <b>time</b>, here&rsquo;s a quick answer: The word &ldquo;<b>thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; does not appear in most English translations of the <b>Bible</b>, but related concepts like praise, gratitude, and giving thanks occur over 250 <b>times</b>.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> weekend travel is also very popular, with over 54 million Americans traveling 50 miles or more from home. <b>Thanksgiving</b> provides a great opportunity to reconnect with loved ones over delicious food and create lasting memories. Giving Thanks and Charity. <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a <b>time</b> to reflect on blessings and practice gratitude.  The word &quot;<b>thanksgiving</b>&quot; or its plural is found thirty <b>times</b> in the KJV, nine of which occur in the New Testament (2Corinthians 4:15, 9:11 - 12, Philippians 4:6, Colossians 2:7, 4:2, 1Timothy 4:3 - 4, Revelation 7:12). Of these nine occurrences, the apostle Paul refers to <b>thanksgiving</b> toward God eight <b>times</b> while John refers to it only once.  The concept of <b>thanksgiving</b> is <b>mentioned</b> 62 <b>times</b> within the New Testament, and intriguingly, over three-quarters of these mentions occur within Paul&rsquo;s letters. Paul stands out as the only New Testament writer who explicitly exhorts believers to practice thankfulness.  Sometimes it can seem difficult, but looking at passages like these in the <b>Bible</b> can reveal how much there is for which we can give thanks to the Lord.

After a quick search at blueletterbible.org (one of my favorite websites), I discovered that the specific words &quot;thank,&quot; &quot;thanks,&quot; and &quot;<b>thanksgiving</b>&quot; appear nearly 150 <b>times</b> in the English Standard Version of the Old and New Testaments. The ancient priests gave offerings and sacrifices of <b>thanksgiving</b> to God (1 Chronicles 16:4, 2 Chronicles 29:31).
