        <p>Unleavened bread was the order of the <b>day</b> at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Cornbread was a clear choice for the 1621 feast &mdash; no yeast was required, there was plenty of corn around, and it&#39;s delicious. For Plymouth settlers, cornbread, or &quot;maizium&quot; as it was also known, was yet another influence from the Wampanoag diet.  These foods <b>include</b> <b>carrots</b>, <b>onions</b>, <b>squash</b>, <b>pumpkins</b>, <b>beans</b>, <b>lettuce</b>, <b>chestnuts</b> and <b>various</b> <b>herbs</b>. Although not specifically mentioned in the accounts of the First Thanksgiving, they were probably there. But no mashed potatoes, alas. And perhaps worse, no cranberry sauce.  What Was on the Menu at the First Thanksgiving?

What was the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>food</b>? Find out what was served at the very first Thanksgiving (and what wasn&#39;t) from wildfowl to produce.  What Did the Pilgrims Eat on the First <b>Thanksgiving</b>? Many dishes served during modern Thanksgiving meals were not present at the first Thanksgiving. The colonists didn&rsquo;t have potatoes, nor did they have butter or flour necessary for making pies. The pilgrims hadn&rsquo;t even built their first oven by the time of the first Thanksgiving.  Massasoit sent some of his own men to hunt deer for <b>the </b>feast and for three days, <b>the </b>English and native men, women, and children ate together. <b>The </b>meal consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and... </p>        <p><a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/thanksgiving1/462.html">Thanksgiving glyphs 3rd grade</a>.
