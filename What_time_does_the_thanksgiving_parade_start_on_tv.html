        <p>Thanksgiving always falls on the <b>fourth</b> Thursday in <b>November</b>, but in 2024 it falls on the last possible date. Here&#39;s what to know about the holiday.  Thanksgiving Day in the United States is a holiday on the fourth Thursday <b>of</b> <b>November</b>. The day after is also known as Black Friday. Is Thanksgiving Day a Public Holiday? This is a state public holiday. State government offices are closed. Some schools and businesses may also be closed on this day.  In 2024, <b>Thanksgiving</b> will be observed on Thursday, <b>November</b> 28. <b>Thanksgiving</b> has been held on the fourth Thursday in <b>November</b> since 1941, which means that the date of the holiday shifts each <b>year</b>. The earliest <b>Thanksgiving</b> can occur is <b>November</b> 22; the latest is <b>November</b> 28.  This year, Thanksgiving falls on that latest possible date of <b>Nov</b>. <b>28</b>. That later date will bring less than four weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which falls on Wednesday, Dec. 25.  For a time, Thanksgiving was celebrated on Nov. 25 beginning in 1668, but that lasted only <b>five</b> years, according to the Farmer&#39;s Almanac. Why is Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday of November?  Caleb Strong, Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, declared the holiday in 1813, &quot;for a day of public <b>thanksgiving</b> and prayer&quot; for Thursday, <b>November</b> <b>25</b> of that <b>year</b>. [45] Madison also declared the holiday twice in 1815; however, neither of these was celebrated in autumn.  Roughly 46 million turkeys are consumed on <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, according to a 2017 news release by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which is roughly 21% of the total number of birds raised each <b>year</b>.  In 2024, we celebrate Thanksgiving on November <b>28</b>. It always falls on the fourth Thursday of the month, a rule set by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1941.  Thanksgiving falls on <b>Thursday</b>, <b>November</b> <b>28</b>, <b>2024</b>. Knowing the date year after year might sound tricky, but it could be easier to remember it like this: Thanksgiving always falls on the fourth Thursday of November! </p>        <p>Stores open on thanksgiving in fayetteville nc.
