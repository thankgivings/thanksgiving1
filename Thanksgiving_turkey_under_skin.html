        <p>O sing <b>unto</b> the <b>LORD</b> <b>with</b> <b>thanksgiving</b>; * sing praises upon the harp unto our God: Who covereth the heaven with clouds, and prepareth rain for the earth; * and maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains, and herb for the use of men; Who giveth fodder unto the cattle, * and feedeth the young ravens that call upon him.  Make <b>us</b>, <b>we</b> <b>pray</b>, faithful stewards of your great bounty, for the provision of our necessities and the relief of all who are in need, to the glory of your Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen.  Once a staple of the daily offices of the Protestant Episcopal Church in America, the General <b>Thanksgiving</b> is one of the most beloved prayers in the Prayer Book. The prayer was authored by Bishop Edward Reynolds (1599-1676), the only Puritan to accept a Bishopric at the time of the Restoration.  We thank you <b>for </b>the splendor of the whole creation, <b>for </b>the beauty of this world, <b>for </b>the wonder of life, and <b>for </b>the mystery of love. We thank you <b>for </b>the blessing of family and friends, and <b>for </b>the loving care which surrounds us on every side.  <b>O</b> <b>gracious</b> <b>God</b>, who so generously lavishes our lives with goodness, create in our hearts a deep center of gratitude, a center that grows so strong in its thanksgiving that sharing freely of our treasures becomes the norm and the pattern of our existence.  A Series of Prayers of Thanksgiving from the Book of Common Prayer 1979 of the Episcopal Church, USA Station 1 A General Thanksgiving <b>Accept</b>, <b>O</b> Lord, our thanks and praise for all that you have done for us. We thank you for the splendor of the whole creation, for the beauty of this world, for the wonder of life, and for the mystery of love.  <b>Prayers</b> from the <b>Episocpal</b> Book of Common <b>Prayer</b>.

We offer <b>thanksgiving</b> to God &ldquo;for all the blessings of this life, for our redemption, and for whatever draws us closer to God&rdquo; (p. 857). The eucharistic <b>prayer</b>, from the Sursum corda through the people&#39;s Amen, is known as the Great <b>Thanksgiving</b> (see BCP, p. 361).  <b>prayers</b> of the people for the liturgical seasons, devotional prayers for use throughout the day, options to use for a UTO Ingathering service, and resources for home or church around the Thanksgiving holiday.
