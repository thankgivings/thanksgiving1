        <h2><strong>Drawing of thanksgiving 2024 macys thanksgiving parade live stream</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> (French: Action de gr&acirc;ce) or Thanksgiving Day (French: Jour de l&#39;Action de gr&acirc;ce), is an annual Canadian holiday held on the second Monday in October. [1] Outside the country, it may be referred to as Canadian Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the American holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions .  The <b>origin</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>in Canada</b> isn&rsquo;t completely clear. Indigenous Peoples marked the fall harvest with prayer, dance and potlatch thousands of years before colonial settlers celebrated.  Thanksgiving in Canada originated purely as <b>a</b> <b>harvest</b> <b>festival</b>. On January 31, 1957, the Canadian Parliament proclaimed: A Day of General Thanksgiving to Almighty God for the bountiful harvest with which Canada has been blessed &ndash; to be observed on the 2nd Monday in October. English explorer Martin Frobisher hosted the first Canadian ...  The first large, national Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated in <b>1859</b> in what was then called the province of Canada. The province of Canada was developed when Upper Canada and Lower Canada were united by Britain in 1841.  Canada was the first country <b>in</b> <b>North</b> America to celebrate Thanksgiving. In fact, the Indigenous Peoples of Canada have been having annual fall harvest thanksgiving celebrations for hundreds of years prior to the arrival of European settlers.  The first official, annual Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated <b>on</b> <b>6</b> <b>November</b> <b>1879</b>, though Indigenous peoples in Canada have a history of celebrating the fall harvest that predates the arrival of European settlers.  Canadian Thanksgiving kicked off with a feast of biscuits, salt beef, and mushy peas in <b>1578</b>. That&rsquo;s when Sir Martin Frobisher sailed from England in search of the Northwest Passage.  In this article I take a brief look at the origins of <b>Thanksgiving</b> and its celebration here <b>in Canada</b>, given that we will all be celebrating on October 14th. We all learned as children about the American <b>Thanksgiving</b> myth of the first US <b>Thanksgiving</b> but what of the early Canadian celebrations.  Days of <b>thanksgiving</b> <b>in Canada</b> also <b>originated</b> in the colonial period, arising from the same European traditions, in gratitude for safe journeys, peace, and bountiful harvests. The earliest celebration was held in 1578, when an expedition led by Martin Frobisher held a ceremony in present-day Nunavut to give thanks for the safety of its fleet. </p>        <p>Fall thanksgiving craft ideas.
