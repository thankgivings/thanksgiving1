        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving recipe sides Image family at thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>The United States holiday of Thanksgiving is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest <b>feast</b> celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  <b>Thanksgiving </b>is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American <b>Thanksgiving </b>to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  Why do we celebrate Thanksgiving? Find out when Thanksgiving <b>became</b> a national holiday, why it&#39;s on a Thursday and any other Thanksgiving <b>questions</b>.  At least 90 Native men and 50 Englishmen came to the <b>feast</b>, Plimoth Plantation colonial foodways culinary expert Kathleen Wall told Time. The Native people dined sitting on the ground, like they...  Originally an English tradition, days of <b>thanksgiving </b>typically were marked by religious services to give thanks to God, or to celebrate a bountiful harvest. The first recorded religious...  Thanksgiving Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a 1621 harvest <b>feast</b> shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  Most Americans are familiar with the Pilgrim&#39;s Thanksgiving <b>Feast</b> of 1621, but few realize that it was not the first festival of its kind in North America. Long before Europeans set foot in the Americas, native peoples sought to insure a good harvest with dances and rituals such as the Green Corn Dance of the Cherokees.  Worldwide, the values and traditions of thanksgiving are found in every culture and religion. The Thanksgiving holiday celebrated each November in the United States is a cherished American tradition, but its roots go far back into human history, according to research conducted by The Center for World Thanksgiving at <b>Thanks-Giving</b> Square.  First Thanksgiving: The 1621 <b>feast</b> included both Pilgrims and Native Americans sharing food, but its history is complex because of the subsequent conflicts between settlers and Indigenous peoples. </p>        <p>Whats open on canada day july 2 2024. <strong>Thanksgiving recipe sides</strong>.
