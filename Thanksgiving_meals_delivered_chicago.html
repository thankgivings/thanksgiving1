        <p>Our Better Nature: What They Ate <b>at</b> the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. At the Pilgrims&rsquo; <b>first</b> autumn harvest feast in 1621, only the beer had European roots. More than 400 years later, Native American crops continue to fill our bellies on <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Paul Hetzler  Since the historic meal in 1621, <b>Thanksgiving</b> traditions <b>have</b> changed and evolved with American culture. From turkey and stuffing to potatoes and pies, we know what dishes to expect at our holiday tables today, but you might be surprised to learn what foods the Pilgrims and Wampanoag brought to the table and what didn&rsquo;t make the cut.  From seafood to carrots, historians report that what was eaten at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years.  So what foods were served at the first Thanksgiving? According to food historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and <b>pigeons</b> may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  The first Thanksgiving banquet consisted of foods <b>like</b> <b>venison</b>, <b>bean</b> <b>stew</b> <b>and</b> <b>hard</b> <b>biscuits</b>. And while corn and pumpkin had their place on the table, they hardly resembled the cornbread stuffing and pumpkin pie we feast on today.  As the weather turns colder, making a hearty batch of stew is a great way to incorporate numerous seasonal ingredients in one dish &mdash; plus it feeds a crowd. &quot;Sobaheg&quot; means stew in the Wampanoag <b>language</b>, and there&#39;s a good chance it was served as part of the first Thanksgiving meal.  Macy&rsquo;s held its <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day Parade just four years later. So these parades and games <b>have</b> <b>been</b> associated with the holiday for more than 100 years now. Parades <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a staple of the <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday since 1920. The best known is the annual Macy&rsquo;s Day Parade in New York City, which began in 1924.  Today, the traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner includes any number of dishes: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, candied yams, cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie.  What was the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> food? Find out what was <b>served</b> <b>at</b> the very <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> (and what wasn&#39;t) from wildfowl to produce. </p>        <p><i>Thanksgiving meals delivered chicago</i>.
