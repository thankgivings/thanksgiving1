        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is a national <b>holiday</b> in the United States, and <b>Thanksgiving</b> 2022 occurs on Thursday, November 24. ... To <b>celebrate</b> the arrival, the 800 Spanish settlers shared a festive meal ...  The legend of the American <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>holiday</b> is said to have been based on a feast of <b>thanksgiving</b> in the early days of the American colonies almost 400 years ago. The tale as it is told in grade schools is a legend, a mythologized version that downplays some of the bleaker history of how <b>Thanksgiving</b> became an American national <b>holiday</b>.  The <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>holiday&#39;s</b> history in North America is rooted in English traditions dating from the Protestant Reformation. It also has aspects of a harvest festival, even though the harvest in New England occurs well before the late-November date on which the modern <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>holiday</b> is celebrated. [1] [2]  As <b>Thanksgiving</b> became an official American <b>holiday</b>, a national mythology formed around it. In a journal that was reprinted in 1856, Plymouth colonist William Bradford had referred to a &ldquo;great store of wild Turkies&rdquo; at Plymouth during the fall in which the &quot;first <b>Thanksgiving</b>&quot; took place.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a U.S. <b>holiday</b> celebrated each year at the end of November. Learn about the history of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, facts about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  Plymouth Colony &amp; First <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The Plymouth Colony was founded by a group comprised of Puritan separatists (the pilgrims) and Anglican settlers who had been hired or invited to join them by the merchant adventurer Thomas Weston (l. 1584 - c. 1647) who secured them a patent from the Virginia Company of London and rented them the Mayflower to establish a profitable colony in Virginia.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day Parades: One of the signature event traditions of <b>the holiday</b>, these parades have become an indistinguishable part of <b>the holiday</b> experience in many American cities, most notably ...  Whenever <b>the holiday</b> season comes around, annual traditions and <b>Thanksgiving</b> activities seem to explode. Family events center around each special occasion, and <b>Thanksgiving</b> is no exception ...  Consequently, the <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>holiday</b> weekend is one of the busiest travel periods of the year. [137] <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a four-day or five-day weekend vacation for schools and colleges. Most business and government workers (78% as of 2007) are given <b>Thanksgiving</b> and the day after as paid <b>holidays</b>.
