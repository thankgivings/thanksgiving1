        <p>&quot;<b>Why</b> do <b>we</b> <b>eat</b> <b>turkey</b> on <b>Thanksgiving</b>?&quot; is a question many of us ask amid the fixings and trimmings. <b>Turkey</b> wasn&rsquo;t always at the heart of the holiday table. <b>We</b> tapped an expert to help explain how <b>turkey</b> became inextricably associated with <b>Thanksgiving</b>, and here&#39;s what <b>we</b> found out.  How did <b>turkey</b> become the centerpiece of this feast? It is often assumed that today&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> menu originated in an event commonly referred to as the &ldquo;first <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&rdquo; There is indeed evidence of a meal shared between Pilgrim settlers at Plymouth colony (in what is now Massachusetts) and Wampanoag people in late 1621.  The fact that wild turkeys are native to North America made them a natural choice to be served at early <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebrations. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they were always the most important part of the feast. In fact, the event <b>we</b> now think of as The First <b>Thanksgiving</b> may not have had any <b>turkey</b> at all.  In 1789, George Washington issued a <b>Thanksgiving</b> Proclamation asking all citizens to give thanks together as a country on November 26. It may be because of this first official celebration and a remark supposedly made by Alexander Hamilton that <b>turkey</b> is the traditional food for <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  As the holiday grew in popularity, however, <b>turkey</b> became the main course for reasons more practical than symbolic. English settlers were accustomed to <b>eating</b> fowl on holidays, but for early...  Thanks to letters and records kept by early American settlers, <b>we</b> know that when the colonists sat down to dine with the Wampanoag Indians, beef and fowl were on the menu. This historical meal would later become known as the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  <b>Why</b> exactly the <b>Turkey</b> has been the star of &ldquo;<b>Turkey</b> Day&rdquo; since at least the mid-19th century is a matter of much debate, particularly given the consensus amongst historians that the Pilgrims...  We spoke to food historians to discover exactly when we started <b>eating</b> <b>turkey</b> on <b>Thanksgiving</b> and why it has endured as a Thanksgiving tradition. Plus, we got some information on the latest...  How did the <b>turkey</b> become a popular <b>Thanksgiving</b> centerpiece? Did the Pilgrims <b>eat</b> <b>turkey</b>? What about pumpkin pie? See how foods differed from today&mdash;and some historically inspired recipes, too! </p>        <p>Thank you letter for sponsor lucky draw.
