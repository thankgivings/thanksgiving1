        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving words with p Redskins vs dallas thanksgiving day</strong></h2>
        <p>Here&rsquo;s some <b>Thanksgiving</b> advice from etiquette pros, including The Emily Post Institute, social strategist Deborah Ritch, president and founder of RitchImage, and the U.S. State Department. 1....  Do I need to accommodate their <b>food</b> restrictions? A. I&rsquo;m assuming you know about your guests&rsquo; food restrictions because you asked them in advance if they had any, which is always a good idea. While you don&rsquo;t need to serve Tofurkey with gluten free mushroom gravy, do try to have one or two dishes your guests can eat.  Here&rsquo;s what you should consider before you bring your world-famous pumpkin pie or a bottle of wine to a family or friend&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner, courtesy of etiquette experts.

Don&rsquo;t say when the meal is to be served, or your <b>guests</b> will arrive at the last moment. <b>Ask</b> some close friends or good conversationalists to come early and be the first <b>guests</b>.

Trust us, your host will call on you if they need you.  Now, if the host asks you if you want <b>to take</b> your <b>food</b> <b>home</b> with you because it was never served, by all means, indulge them. But don&rsquo;t make it a point to angle for your pecan pie when you notice it sat on the counter untouched.  Here are their top 10 suggestions for how to be a <b>guest</b> who is always invited back. If you&rsquo;re invited to <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner, reply immediately.
