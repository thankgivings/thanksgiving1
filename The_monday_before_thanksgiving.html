        <h2><strong>The monday before thanksgiving Thanksgiving or thansgiven</strong></h2>
        <p>National <b>Holiday</b>: <b>Yes</b> -- Thanksgiving is observed in all 50 states in the U.S. No -- optional in Atlantic Canada (NL, NS, NB, PEI) Origins: Thanksgiving was founded as a religious observance for all the members of the community to give thanks to God for a common purpose.  While the actual <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>holiday</b> is on a Monday, Canadians may gather for their <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast on any day during the long weekend; however, Sunday is considered the most common.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> (action de gr&acirc;ce in French) or <b>Thanksgiving</b> day, is an official statutory <b>holiday</b> in all Canadian provinces and territories except Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. Canadians have been celebrating <b>Thanksgiving</b> day as an official statutory <b>holiday</b> since 1879.  Believe it or not, <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>in</b> <b>Canada</b>, or at least the land that would become Canada, has its own history, separate from our American counterparts. Traditions of giving thanks long predate the arrival of European settlers in North America.  Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving on the second Monday in <b>October</b>, while Thanksgiving in the United States is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November. When is Thanksgiving in Canada? In 2025, Thanksgiving in Canada is Monday, October 13.  Despite its <b>religious</b> roots, it has become a secular occasion for gatherings of friends and family to feast and give thanks. Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> has unique origins that distinguish it from the American <b>holiday</b>, preceding the United States <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>holiday</b> in Plymouth Plantation by 43 years.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a national <b>holiday</b> celebrated on various dates in October and November in the United States, <b>Canada</b>, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is an annual national <b>holiday</b> in the United States and Canada that celebrates the blessings of the past year. How did Thanksgiving start? Colonists in New England and Canada regularly observed &ldquo;thanksgivings,&rdquo; days of prayer for such blessings as safe journeys, military victories, or abundant harvests.  While it originally celebrated harvests, today it&rsquo;s about giving thanks for all the good in our lives. It&rsquo;s a <b>non</b>-<b>religious</b> <b>holiday</b> that fosters inclusivity across cultures and beliefs. Thanksgiving in Canada embodies a spirit of unity and gratitude.
