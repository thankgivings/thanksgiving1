        <h2><strong>Giant food stores open thanksgiving day Thanksgiving chair cover ideas</strong></h2>
        <p>Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the fourth Thursday of <b>November</b>. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  BU Today: What do we know about the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> and what might have been included on the menu? Metheny: The &ldquo;First <b>Thanksgiving</b>,&rdquo; which took place in the fall of 1621 at the site of Patuxet (present-day Plymouth, Mass.), was reflective of several English traditions: a harvest festival, typically held in the autumn after the harvest was successfully brought in, as well as a religious ...  <b>But</b> <b>cornmeal</b> &mdash; usually ground from another hard maize called dent corn &mdash; is one of a handful of main ingredients found on Thanksgiving tables across the continental United States, baked into...  Corn is a <b>Thanksgiving</b> staple representing survival, tradition, and cultural exchange. ... The Pilgrims likely had some familiarity with maize, however, as it had been introduced to Europe earlier ...  While the day after <b>Thanksgiving </b>is often associated with leftovers and shopping deals, it&rsquo;s also <b>Maize </b>Day &ndash; a tribute to one of the oldest and most significant crops in the Americas. Let&rsquo;s dive into the importance of <b>maize </b>(corn) and how to honor its impact.  There are indications that the Maya and other Mesoamerican peoples worshiped a <b>maize </b>god who they considered to be an important source of life and reproduction. Additionally, corn plants were used for purposed other than just producing grain.  Turkey, corn (or maize), pumpkins and cranberry sauce are symbols which represent the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>. These symbols are frequently seen on holiday decorations and greeting cards. The use of corn meant the survival of the colonies.  The origin of corn (or <b>maize</b>) is said to have begun in Mexico some 9,000 years ago. It&#39;s a complex history that&#39;s made its way to our <b>Thanksgiving </b>tables in the form of cornbread, which was originally just a mixture of ground cornmeal and water that&#39;s stirred together and baked over an open fire.  <b>Corn</b> (maize) was domesticated in Mexico more than 8,000 years ago. This important crop plant arrived in the southwestern United States by 4,000 years ago, and reached eastern North America at about 200 B.C. </p>        <p>Happy thanksgiving in hawaiian.
