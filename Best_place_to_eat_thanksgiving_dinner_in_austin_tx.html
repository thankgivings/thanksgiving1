        <h2><strong>Best place to eat thanksgiving dinner in austin tx Thanksgiving dinner greenville south carolina</strong></h2>
        <p>This was the <b>first</b> community act of religion and <b>thanksgiving</b> in the <b>first</b> permanent European settlement in North America. It took <b>place</b> just 300 yards north of the Castillo de San Marcos, at what is now the Mission of Nombre de Dios. This event is commemorated today by a 250 foot cross which stands on the original landing site. Today&#39;s Holiday  Plymouth Colony &amp; <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The Plymouth Colony was founded by a group comprised of Puritan separatists (the pilgrims) and Anglican settlers who had been hired or invited to join them by the merchant adventurer Thomas Weston (l. 1584 - c. 1647) who secured them a patent from the Virginia Company of London and rented them the Mayflower to establish a profitable colony in Virginia.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  The meal consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and roasted meat, different from today&#39;s traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast. They played ball games, sang, and danced. Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the <b>first</b> recorded religious <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623.  Here&#39;s what we really know about the <b>first Thanksgiving</b>, which took <b>place</b> in Plymouth in 1621 among the Pilgrims and Native Americans. Turkey wasn&#39;t the star of the meal.  As you can gather from Winslow&rsquo;s diary entry, the guest list for the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> ended up with more Wampanoag tribe members than Pilgrims (very different from the many artistic portrayals of the event), as the population of 100 colonists had been cut in half by a harsh winter.  November 30, 1876: <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> Football Game. The very <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> football game was played between Princeton and Yale in 1876. American football was in its infancy, but the sport ...  But there was a gathering in 1621 that looked at least a bit like this. We all know this event took <b>place</b> in Plymouth, Massachusetts. But <b>did</b> you ever wonder where, specifically, this scene played out? For people visiting Plymouth during the holiday, it might be of interest to know where the <b>first &ldquo;Thanksgiving&rdquo;</b> took <b>place</b>.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is a national holiday in the United States, and <b>Thanksgiving</b> 2022 occurs on Thursday, November 24. In 1621, the Plymouth colonists and Wampanoag Indians shared an autumn harvest ... </p>        <p><a href="./589.html">Thanksgiving prayer for new baby</a>.
