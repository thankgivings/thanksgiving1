        <p>How many sides should you serve at Thanksgiving? For a small group, <b>3</b> <b>sides</b> <b>should</b> be enough. However, the more people you&#39;re inviting to Thanksgiving dinner, the more sides you should have prepared to make sure all of your guests stay satisfied.  How many side dishes should you have on Thanksgiving? How many side dishes you need depends on your guest list, oven space and family traditions. We suggest <b>making</b> <b>two</b> to <b>four</b> of your family&rsquo;s favorite sides, then encouraging guests to bring any other must-have dishes.  <b>Three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>bites</b> <b>of</b> food per <b>person</b> should be plenty. For shrimp cocktail, oysters or larger crostini, plan about two pieces per person. If you&#39;re serving smaller, one-bite hors...  Let&#39;s say that your dinner table will have <b>eight</b> <b>people</b>, how many sides should you prepare? Coogan says, &quot;For Thanksgiving, where part of the celebration is the bounty, I like to have at least four sides &mdash; such as stuffing, mashed sweet potatoes , Brussels sprouts , and saut&eacute;ed greens.&quot;  Do you need to calculate how much turkey, stuffing, <b>side</b> dishes, and drinks to buy, cook and serve for your <b>Thanksgiving</b> Dinner guests? Well, that&rsquo;s easy; just use the <b>Thanksgiving</b> Dinner calculator.  We asked the pros how much food to make for small, medium, and large <b>Thanksgiving</b> gatherings, and put it all together for you in an easy-to-read chart. Take a look so you can make the right amount of turkey, stuffing, gravy, potatoes, sides, and desserts for you and your guests.  In fact, when it comes to Thanksgiving, you should aim for <b>three</b> to <b>five</b> side dishes. This may seem like a small number, but remember that the turkey is the star of the show. You don&rsquo;t want your sides to overshadow it.  We&#39;ll get you through the day, one decision at a time: how to cook the turkey, which <b>sides</b> to serve, what to make ahead and how to end the meal.  For 8 people, choose 1-3 appetizers and <b>3</b> <b>sides</b>. For 16 people, choose 2-3 appetizers and 3 or more sides. Choose between a turkey breast for 4 people and a whole roasted turkey for 8 or 16 people. For four people, we recommend the Bacon-Wrapped Turkey Breast. </p>        <p>Vegan thanksgiving recipes 2024. Walmart wichita ks thanksgiving hours. Thanksgiving in all countries.
