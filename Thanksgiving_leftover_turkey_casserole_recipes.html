        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving leftover turkey casserole recipes Thanksgiving in disney</strong></h2>
        <p>Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated on various dates <b>in</b> <b>October</b> <b>and</b> <b>November</b> in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  It is intended to celebrate the blessings of the past year. Thanksgiving Day became an official U.S. holiday <b>in</b> <b>1863</b>, and in 1942 the federal government designated the fourth Thursday in November as Thanksgiving.  Gimbels department store hosted its first <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day Parade in Philadelphia in 1920 to promote the <b>start</b> of the Christmas retail season. Macy&rsquo;s held its first <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day Parade just four <b>years</b> later. So these parades and games have been associated with the holiday for more than 100 <b>years</b> now.  Thanksgiving Day, observed in <b>2024</b> on Thursday, November 28, honors a 1621 feast between Plymouth colonists and the Wampanoag people.  From the earliest fall feasts to the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> football game to the Macy&#39;s Day parade, here&#39;s the full background on how the U.S. holiday evolved to the tradition it is today.  Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>of</b> <b>November</b>.

The first <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a harvest celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written. The first account is William Bradford&#39;s journal&hellip;  It wasn&#39;t until 1863 that President Abraham Lincoln made his <b>Thanksgiving</b> Proclamation, giving birth to the holiday the United States has celebrated annually in November ever since (although the ...  The First Thanksgiving is dated <b>to</b> <b>1621</b>. When did Thanksgiving become an American holiday?
