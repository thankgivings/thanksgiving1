        <p>The 9/11 Memorial Museum is now open five days a <b>week</b> with new health and safety measures in place and ongoing operational changes to ensure a safe Museum experience. All visitors must wear CDC-approved masks and purchase tickets in advance for timed visits that allow for social distancing.  The <b>9/11</b> <b>Museum</b> is adjacent to the Memorial and opened in May 2014. It includes over 70,000 artifacts recovered from the wreckage of the Twin Towers. Items like rubble and the huge, twisted steel cross beams make you realize just how devastating these attacks were.  All visitors to the 9/11 Memorial <b>Museum</b> are subject to <b>security</b> screening. <b>Museum</b> visitors will pass through magnetometers. Alternative screening techniques, including hand-wanding, are also available. Please limit the amount of items that you bring with you.  To better accommodate visitors visiting New York City this holiday season, the <b>9/11</b> Memorial <b>Museum</b> will observe adjusted hours. From Thursday, December 26, through Monday, December 30, the <b>Museum</b> will remain open until 9 p.m.  Visit the website for opening days and times. The memorial and <b>museum</b> honor those who lost their lives in both the <b>9/11</b> attacks and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Combined, these tragic events were responsible for the deaths of 2,983 people.  Be prepared to show your identification and go through a <b>security</b> screening. Plan to spend at least an hour at the Memorial. Even if you&rsquo;re not a &quot;typical tourist,&quot; there is so much to absorb and process.  On Sunday, the <b>9/11</b> Memorial will reopen to the general public with new operational safeguards following a months-long closure because of the health crisis. The Memorial will be open with adjusted hours&mdash;from 1 to 8 p.m., seven days a week&mdash;to facilitate regular deep cleanings.  Through commemoration, exhibitions, and educational programs, the National September 11 Memorial <b>&amp; Museum</b>, a nonprofit in New York City, remembers and honors the 2,983 people killed in the horrific attacks of September 11, 2001, and February 26, 1993, as well as those who risked their lives to save others and all who demonstrated extraordinary ...
