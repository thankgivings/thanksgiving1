        <h2><strong>Las vegas thanksgiving football Quick thanksgiving art projects</strong></h2>
        <p>Five ways to have a politically <b>correct</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> this year, from volunteering at homeless shelters to cooking a vegan meal.  Teaching about <b>Thanksgiving</b> in a socially responsible way means that educators accept the ethical obligation to provide students with accurate information and to reject traditions that sustain harmful stereotypes about Indigenous peoples.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is even becoming an anomaly in stores and businesses today in favor of being politically <b>correct</b>. As I was checking out at a store register yesterday, the employee at the cash register said to me &ldquo;Have a nice holiday&rdquo;.  Originally, <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Proclamations</b> were simply a call for a day of solemn reflection and expression of thanks to a Supreme Being. Over time, the Proclamations changed to add language claiming a distinctively American Thanksgiving history and to call for reinforcement of certain core values. (Jump to the list of proclamations)  Despite potentially dreaded <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>political</b> conversations, research has found most people don&rsquo;t find those conversations so bad once they happen.  For many Americans, the image of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is one of supposed unity: the gathering of &ldquo;Pilgrims and Indians&rdquo; in a harmonious feast. But this version obscures the harsh truth, one steeped in...  But many Native Americans say <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is a reminder of the slaughter of millions of Indigenous people and the theft of their lands by outsiders.  What are some meaningful ways educators can teach their students about Thanksgiving? Replace &ldquo;Indians&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pilgrims&rdquo; with more specific names: <b>Wampanoag</b> and English or Separatists. As responsible educators, we need to encourage our students to use more accurate terms.  The key here is <b>intent</b>. Anyone who says Happy Hitler Day is intending to be provocative. No response is called for. Do not feed the trolls. Silence in that case is both polite and not indicative of support. Someone who wishes a person Happy Thanksgiving likely has good intentions as it is a overwhelming celebrated federal holiday. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving in white plains for needy poor.
