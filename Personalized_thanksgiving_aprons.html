        <h2><strong>Personalized thanksgiving aprons Thanksgiving facts sheet</strong></h2>
        <p>What&#39;s the difference between <b>Thanksgiving</b> in America and <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b>? In the United States, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November but in <b>Canada</b>, it is celebrated on the second Monday in October (which is Columbus Day in the U.S.).  In this article I take a brief look at the origins of <b>Thanksgiving</b> and its celebration here in <b>Canada</b>, given that we will all be celebrating on October 14th. We all learned as children about the American <b>Thanksgiving</b> myth of the first US <b>Thanksgiving</b> but what of the early Canadian celebrations.  Here is how <b>Canada</b> celebrates their big holiday as well as four ways that the Canadian and U.S. Thanksgivings differ. 1. Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is in October&mdash;and on a Monday. That&rsquo;s right! Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> happens a full month and a half before American <b>Thanksgiving</b>, on the second Monday in October (Monday, October 14, 2024).  Why Do We Celebrate? Canadian Thanksgiving is rooted in <b>Indigenous</b> <b>values</b>, including giving thanks for surviving winter and for receiving crops and game as a reward for their hard work. First Nations traditions would include feasting, prayer, dance and other ceremonies.  It is thought that one reason for the timing of Canadian Thanksgiving being so much earlier than American Thanksgiving is <b>because</b> Canada <b>is</b> <b>further</b> <b>north</b>, <b>and</b> they celebrate the Fall Harvest earlier in the year.  The first official, annual Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated <b>on</b> <b>6</b> <b>November</b> <b>1879</b>, though Indigenous peoples in Canada have a history of celebrating the fall harvest that predates the arrival of European settlers.  Here are six ways Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> differs from the US holiday. The date of the true first <b>Thanksgiving</b> is hotly contested. Some historians believe it occurred not in the US, but in...  Today Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is held on the second Monday of October every year, or at least it has been since Canadian Parliament declared it so on January 31, 1957. Before this, <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b> had been held sporadically, often coinciding with other major events and anniversaries.  Since 1957, Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> has been celebrated on the second Monday of October. This change was made to separate the celebration of the harvest from the Remembrance Day commemorations of Canadian War veterans held in November. </p>        <p><a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/thanksgiving1/208.html">How did the first thanksgiving affect america</a>.
