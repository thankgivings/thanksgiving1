        <h2><strong>The british celebrate thanksgiving on the fourth thursday in november Visiting new york thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>When it comes to Thanksgiving sides, our turkey stuffing is always on the must-make list. Whether you call it stuffing or dressing, this traditional stuffing <b>recipe</b> is a crowd-pleasing classic for holiday gatherings, boasting the perfect blend of herbs, pillowy soft bread, butter, and fresh veggies.  Use these tips and tricks to learn how to <b>stuff</b> a <b>turkey</b>&mdash;<b>and</b> how to cook it safely without drying out the meat. Whether you call it stuffing or dressing, no Thanksgiving dinner is complete without this iconic side dish.  Traditional <b>stuffing</b> should be stuffed inside the <b>turkey</b> and cooked in there, but that isn&rsquo;t the ideal or even recommended way to cook your <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>turkey</b> (or <b>stuffing</b>). I&#39;ve found...  A classic, traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>stuffing</b> that is perfectly moist and perfectly seasoned with onion, celery, and sage. It will be the star of your feast, and the only <b>stuffing</b> <b>recipe</b> you&#39;ll ever need!  3 cups of cooked &amp; <b>chopped</b> brown <b>turkey</b> <b>meat</b> from your roasted turkey. 3 cups of turkey broth or pan drippings. Seasonings: Teaspoon salt, &frac12; teaspoon pepper, &frac12; teaspoon sage, and half a teaspoon garlic powder. I do not bake stuffing in the turkey cavity because it can make it stuffing mushy and slow the cooking of Turkey.  My Grandma&rsquo;s Thanksgiving <b>Turkey</b> <b>Stuffing</b> has stood the test of time. This buttery, savory, melt-in-your-mouth <b>stuffing</b> is the best <b>stuffing</b> <b>recipe</b> around! Are you all so excited that Thanksgiving is almost here? I think I love Thanksgiving more than Christmas. And one reason why? The food, of course!  Classic <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Stuffing</b> - This will be the only <b>stuffing</b> <b>recipe</b> you will ever need! So much fresh herbs and so buttery. It&#39;s simply the best EVER!  Whether you&#39;re learning how to make <b>stuffing</b> for the first time or have made this classic side dish many times before, our <b>recipe</b> will give you the confidence to experiment with new flavor combinations. Most <b>stuffing</b> has the same foundation: bread. Cornbread comes in as a close second.  The flavor is quintessentially <b>Thanksgiving</b>. With butter, fresh herbs, and saut&eacute;ed onions, celery, and garlic, you&rsquo;ll want a bit of this classic stuffing with every bite of turkey and gravy. You can make it in advance.
