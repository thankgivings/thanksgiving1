        <h2><strong>Turkey supply for thanksgiving Restaurants open on thanksgiving west bloomfield mi</strong></h2>
        <p>What are the Pagan <b>Origins</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b>? Some people believe that there are pagan <b>origins</b> behind the <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebration. The most popular theory is that the holiday is based on ancient pagan harvest festivals. These festivals, which were celebrated in many cultures, honored the gods and goddesses of fertility and the harvest.  The event was a harvest festival with a mix of religious, pagan and practical traditions dating back centuries. ... For this piece on the real <b>history</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, we spoke with Amy Jakober ...  But of all American holidays, this one is neither tied to our patriotic <b>history</b>, or any religious occasion. It&rsquo;s just <b>Thanksgiving</b> and its so much more. Throughout <b>history</b> people have gathered together for great feasts celebrating the harvest or the first beers being brewed, or any of a number of celebrations tied to the earth.  The <b>origins</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, like with most other traditional festivities, are rooted in old pagan rites. The holiday has its earliest source in ancient customs found throughout the globe that allocated a day of giving thanks for a successful harvest and the fortunes or blessings of the previous year.  By Vanessa Falcon Everything has <b>origins</b>: from the stories we tell at the dinner table, to the very holidays we celebrate. <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a well-worshiped, highly celebrated occasion in the United States, but like many other celebrations, this holiday has roots in pagan traditions. From the beginning of the concept surrounding religions and belief systems,  Plymouth Colony &amp; First <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The Plymouth Colony was founded by a group comprised of Puritan separatists (the pilgrims) and Anglican settlers who had been hired or invited to join them by the merchant adventurer Thomas Weston (l. 1584 - c. 1647) who secured them a patent from the Virginia Company of London and rented them the Mayflower to establish a profitable colony in Virginia.  While the story is quite complicated and much blood was shed as colonial forces began to appear on the shores of North America, <b>Thanksgiving</b> remains a time to reflect upon that which is dearest to the heart. Even though this holiday has its <b>origins</b> planted in the soil of America, many of the traditions related to the event stretch back in <b>history</b>.  Being Pagan and Celebrating <b>Thanksgiving</b> and Its <b>Origins</b> Unfortunately, being thankful to the Native peoples of America has all but been washed away in time. We now view <b>Thanksgiving</b> as a time to be thankful for what we have in our lives, which is a WONDERFUL tradition; however, as pagans we should also acknowledge and be thankful for the ...  If you consider <b>Thanksgiving</b> a celebration of ongoing genocide, it&#39;s pretty hard to feel good about chowing down on your turkey and cranberry sauce. Since <b>Thanksgiving</b> isn&#39;t a religious observation&mdash;it&#39;s not a Christian holiday, for example&mdash;many Pagans don&#39;t see it as objectionable from a spiritual perspective. </p>        <p><a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/thanksgiving1/613.html">By the docks thanksgiving</a>.
