This week the U.S. celebrates the holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which has been an official national holiday since President Abraham Lincoln, after a campaign by magazine editor Sarah Josepha Hale, declared it as such in 1863.  Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> Thursday <b>of</b> November. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is a national <b>holiday</b> in the United States, and, in 2024, falls on Thursday, November 28. In 1621, the Plymouth colonists from England and the Native American Wampanoag people...  <b>Thanksgiving</b> as a national <b>holiday</b> owes its origins to Sarah Josepha Hale, who lobbied Abraham Lincoln&mdash;and wrote &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is an annual national <b>holiday</b> in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a <b>holiday</b> in the United States and Canada when people give thanks. In the United States, it is on the fourth Thursday of November. In Canada, it is on the second Monday of October. In 1863, Abraham Lincoln said the last Thursday of November would be a national Day of <b>Thanksgiving</b> for the United States. [1]  The United States <b>holiday</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  In the United States, the Thanksgiving holiday is a <b>four</b>-day holiday over a weekend, starting on Thanksgiving Thursday and ending on Sunday.
