        <h2><strong>What to do with thanksgiving ham leftovers Self magazine thanksgiving recipes</strong></h2>
        <p>The <b>Mashpee</b> <b>Wampanoag</b> first encountered the Pilgrims who arrived on the Mayflower ship in 1620. They say much is missing from the often-told Thanksgiving story.  Puritans and <b>Pilgrims</b> came out of the same religious culture of 1570s England. <b>Pilgrims</b> hosted the first American <b>Thanksgiving</b>, and Puritans arrived later.  In 1620, about 100 religious <b>Pilgrims</b> left England on the Mayflower for the &quot;New World&quot; and landed in modern-day southeastern Massachusetts, a region inhabited by the Wampanoag people.  What really happened at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621? The <b>Pilgrims</b> did not introduce the concept of <b>thanksgiving</b>; the New England tribes already had autumn harvest feasts of thanksgiving.  You&#39;ve probably heard stories about the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> - you know, <b>Pilgrims</b> and <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> coming together for a grand feast. Join us as we review the facts - and do a bit of myth-busting.  Romanticized paintings and stereotypical images of &quot;<b>Pilgrims</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>Indians</b>&quot; celebrating the &quot;First Thanksgiving&quot; became part of the national nostalgia and Manifest Destiny sentiment as the United States pushed west.  The <b>Thanksgiving</b> story deeply rooted in America&rsquo;s school curriculum frames the <b>Pilgrims</b> as the main characters and reduces the Wampanoag <b>Indians</b> to supporting roles.  The myth is that friendly <b>Indians</b>, unidentified by tribe, welcome the Pilgrims to America, teach them how to live in this new place, sit down to dinner with them and then disappear.  The <b>Wampanoag</b> went on to teach their visitors how to hunt, plant crops and how to get the best of their harvest, saving these people, who would go on to be known as the Pilgrims, from starvation, leading to the events of the first Thanksgiving. </p>        <p><a href="./229.html">Walmart open on thanksgiving 2024 near me</a>. <a href="./878.html">Happy thanksgiving profile pictures</a>.
