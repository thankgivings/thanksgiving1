        <p>How long was the first Thanksgiving dinner? It wasn&#39;t just a dinner. It lasted <b>three</b> <b>days</b>. Who was there? About fifty Pilgrims came. Plus 90 Wampanoag Indians.  Have you ever wondered what the <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>ate</b> at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>? We dig into how similar the menu was to the traditional American Thanksgiving meal.  Historians like me who have studied the history of food have found that most modern <b>Thanksgiving</b> traditions began in the mid-19th century, more than two centuries after the <b>Pilgrims</b>&rsquo; first harvest celebration. The reinvention of the <b>Pilgrims</b>&rsquo; celebration as a national holiday was largely the work of Sarah Hale. Born in New Hampshire in 1784 ...  So what foods were served at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to food historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  Two primary sources&mdash;the only surviving documents that reference the meal&mdash;confirm that these staples were part of the harvest celebration shared by the <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoag at Plymouth Colony in...  What Did the <b>Pilgrims</b> Eat on the First <b>Thanksgiving</b>? Many dishes served during modern Thanksgiving meals were not present at the first Thanksgiving. The colonists didn&rsquo;t have potatoes, nor did they have butter or flour necessary for making pies.  For most people, enjoying turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, and pumpkin for <b>Thanksgiving </b>is as traditional and American as, well, apple pie. But how <b>did the Pilgrims </b>really celebrate on...  Turkey, corn, and pumpkin pie are all <b>Thanksgiving</b> staples, but what did the <b>pilgrims</b> actually <b>eat</b> at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>? The answer might surprise you!  When we think of <b>Thanksgiving</b> meats, turkey is top of mind for most of us, and indeed the <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>did</b> <b>eat</b> turkey in 1621, as reported by Plymouth governor William Bradford. Most of the fowl shot by Pilgrim and Native hunters, though, were ducks and geese, as Plymouth lies on a bustling migratory flyway , and waterfowl would have been plentiful ... </p>        <p><a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/thanksgiving1/220.html">Grocery store open christmas day indianapolis</a>.
