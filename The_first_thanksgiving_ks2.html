        <h2><strong>The first thanksgiving ks2 Boston market thanksgiving dinner for 2</strong></h2>
        <p>The Dallas Cowboys have a long history of playing on <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Here&#39;s how it all started, with a full list of games played since the tradition began in <b>1966</b>.  Unlike the Lions, the Cowboys enjoy success on <b>Thanksgiving</b>, posting a 32-22-1 all-time record on the holiday. The Detroit Lions and Dallas <b>Cowboys</b> have long hosted games on Thanksgiving <b>Day</b>....  No team has stood across the field from the Dallas <b>Cowboys</b> on <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> more than the Washington Commanders. Of the <b>Cowboys</b> 55 <b>games</b>, 10 of them have been against the Commanders, dating back to 1968. In honor of the 11th matchup between the NFC East foes on Thursday, here&rsquo;s a look at all 10 <b>games</b>, in which Dallas is 8-2.  The NFL&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> <b>games</b> have traditionally included one game hosted by the Detroit Lions since 1934, and one game hosted by the Dallas <b>Cowboys</b> since 1966 (with two exceptions in 1975 and 1977).  In 2004, quarterback PEYTON MANNING (middle) led the Indianapolis Colts to a convincing 41-9 win over the Detroit Lions by throwing for six touchdowns. RANDY MOSS had three catches for 163 and three touchdowns, leading the Minnesota Vikings to victory over the Dallas <b>Cowboys</b> in an exciting shootout, 46-36. * Non-league team.  While many teams weren&rsquo;t interested, Dallas <b>Cowboys</b> GM Tex Schramm believed the publicity of playing on <b>Thanksgiving</b> would be good for his struggling team in 1966. Schramm&rsquo;s decision paid off on the field and at the gate, which is why the tradition has continued and in part is why the <b>Cowboys</b> are known as &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Team.&rdquo;  In most years, Cowboys players will visit a Salvation Army shelter in Dallas or Fort Worth and feed early Thanksgiving <b>Day</b> meals to those in need, although that practice was put on hold in 2020...  Along with the Detroit Lions, the Dallas <b>Cowboys</b> play on the holiday every season, dating back to 1966 for Dallas (with the exception of 1975 and 1977). We&rsquo;ll look at the <b>Cowboys</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>games</b> from the <b>past</b> 10 seasons, where they&rsquo;re still 4-6 after the dominating 45-10 victory over Washington.  What is the Dallas Cowboys&rsquo; record on Thanksgiving? The Cowboys have <b>gone</b> <b>33</b>-<b>22</b>-<b>1</b> on Thanksgiving since starting its holiday tradition in 1966.
