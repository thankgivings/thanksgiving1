Learn about the history of Thanksgiving, facts about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  In the United States, Thanksgiving Day is celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> in <b>November</b>, as specified in a joint resolution passed by Congress in 1941 and a proclamation issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1942.  The United <b>States</b> holiday of Thanksgiving is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  This week the U.S. celebrates the holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which has been an official national holiday since President Abraham Lincoln, after a campaign by magazine editor Sarah Josepha Hale, declared it as such in 1863.
