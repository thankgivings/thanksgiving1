        <p>Since 1957, Thanksgiving <b>Day</b> has been a holiday <b>in Canada</b> on the second Monday of October. Canadian Thanksgiving is a chance for people to give <b>thanks</b> for fortunes in the past year, including a good harvest. Below, we will explain what people do on Canadian Thanksgiving, as well as the ways that it differs from U.S. Thanksgiving.  When is Thanksgiving in Canada in 2024? Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving on the second <b>Monday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b> and this year the holiday falls on October 14, 2024. It&rsquo;s a time to bid farewell to summer and welcome the cooler months.  Canadian Thanksgiving happens a full month and a half before American Thanksgiving, on the second Monday in October (Monday, October 14, <b>2024</b>). Since the beginning of the Thanksgiving holiday, its date has moved several times&mdash;from mid-week in April to a Thursday in November&mdash;until 1957, when the Canadian government officially declared that ...  In 2024, Thanksgiving falls <b>on</b> <b>October</b> <b>14</b>. This day is dedicated to giving thanks for the harvest and blessings of the past year, and it brings families and friends together for festive meals and activities.  Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving on the second Monday in October, while Thanksgiving in the United States is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November. When is Thanksgiving <b>in Canada</b>? In 2025, Thanksgiving <b>in Canada</b> is Monday, October 13.  This year, Canada celebrates their Thanksgiving Day <b>on</b> <b>Monday</b>, <b>October</b> <b>14</b>, <b>2024</b>. While an American Thanksgiving is always firmly scheduled on the last Thursday of November, Canadians are free to choose any day (or opt to feast for all three days!) over a long and leisurely three-day Thanksgiving weekend in October.  Thanksgiving in Canada is celebrated on the second Monday of October every year. This corresponds to October <b>14</b>, 2024. Canadian Thanksgiving has a rich history and story behind it that is not rooted in the American celebration. Thanksgiving is an official holiday in Canada.
