        <p>Bringing communities together, across the nation, to feed and clothe the <b>homeless</b> and less fortunate on Thanksgiving Day.  If you are looking to have a positive impact on those who are struggling to feed their families, Hearts for the <b>Homeless</b> has a variety of opportunities to help this holiday season through our &lsquo;Feed a Family&rsquo; program.  Carey Moore, 57, spent 18 years in prison and roughly 20 years <b>homeless</b>. A sinewy man with graying long hair and a gravelly voice, he&#39;s learned not to give a damn about Thanksgiving or birthdays...  The only contact I had ever had with <b>homeless</b> people was when I had occasionally&mdash;and gingerly&mdash;handed one a quarter on the street. And I had no desire to deal with them without that plastic barrier&mdash;the one that separated me and the food from them&mdash;between us.  Yet, more than 580,000 people remain <b>homeless</b>, with many of them sleeping outdoors. Many are minors, families with small children, people with disabilities, or veterans. And each one of them deserves a safe, stable place to call home.  Food banks, food pantries, soup kitchens, and faith groups offer free <b>Thanksgiving </b>meals. Learn how to find a free <b>thanksgiving </b>meal near you.  This Thanksgiving, join people around the country in donating to your local homeless <b>shelter</b>, and share in the joy of helping those who have no permanent place to call home. Below are items that are in demand at local shelters right now.  Union Mission will host a free <b>Thanksgiving </b>meal from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., on Wednesday, Nov. 27 at its headquarters at 125 Fahm St. This year&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving </b>meal is sponsored by Gulfstream and...  There are many ways you can make a difference for families struggling with hunger this holiday season. However, the holidays are a very busy time for our partner food banks and are a very popular time to volunteer. We have a few tips to help you get started: Contact a food bank or food pantry near you about volunteering well before the holidays. </p>        <p>Costco thanksgiving treats.
