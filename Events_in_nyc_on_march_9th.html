        <p>Want to donate a Thanksgiving food <b>basket</b> for a <b>needy</b> family in your town? Here is what to put in a Thanksgiving gift <b>basket</b> for a family in need!  Putting together a <b>Thanksgiving </b>Meal Box is easy and through <b>the </b>process, I learned a few things. Here is a list of items I purchased at Walmart: 1. Boxed Stuffing. 2. Packet of Gravy. 3. Canned Vegetables. 4. Canned Cranberry Sauce. 5. Canned Pumpkin. 6. Pie Crust. 7. Bag of Potatoes. 8. Bottle of Apple Cider.  Ask family, friends or volunteers at your office (or at your place of worship or social club) to put together <b>baskets</b> or bags of holiday dinner staples for families in <b>need</b>. It&rsquo;s simple! Ask each volunteer to shop for the items on the list below.  Planning a Thanksgiving <b>basket</b> can be simple and fun, making it an ideal Thanksgiving activity to get the kids involved in. The first thing to do is to plan the menu. If you know the family who is receiving your basket, then you can ask them about their favorite Thanksgiving dishes and create a custom menu for their basket.  Creating Thanksgiving Baskets for the Needy. When putting together a Thanksgiving basket for the needy, it&rsquo;s important to consider the essential items that will help them enjoy a hearty and festive meal. One of the first items to include is a box of mashed <b>potatoes</b>, which is a staple dish for Thanksgiving dinner. </p>        <p><a href="./898.html">Clever desserts for thanksgiving</a>.
