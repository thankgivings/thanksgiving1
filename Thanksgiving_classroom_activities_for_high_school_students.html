        <p>advanced <b>satanic</b> ritual. <b>thanksgiving</b> ritual. consecrating and empowering your ritual tools. prayer for protection. destruction ritual. banishing ritual. ritual for cursing the christian church and the foul nazarene. the truth concerning the &quot;shemhamphorash&quot; back to <b>satanic</b> rites &amp; celebrations main page  While <b>Thanksgiving </b>is not tied to any one specific religion, it&rsquo;s traditions are quite similar to a number of ancient Pagan harvest celebrations. For example, in ancient Rome they celebrated the holiday of Cerelia, which honored the harvest goddess of grain called Ceres.  Several times throughout Scripture, God&rsquo;s people are urged to offer a sacrifice of <b>thanksgiving</b>. &ldquo;Sacrifice&rdquo; sounds more brutal than beautiful, doesn&rsquo;t it? If you listen to podcasts, you may have heard the popular phrase &ldquo;this is saving my life&rdquo; tossed around.  Since <b>Satanism</b> is a self-centered religion, the highest holiday of the year would be the Satanist&rsquo;s own birthday, which needs no ritual but should be spent in doing things a Satanist would enjoy. There is no requirement that a Satanist celebrate any holidays, and there are no hard and fast traditions or rites associated with them.  You could call it the true story of thanksgiving &mdash; or you could call it the Christian gospel viewed through the lens of that often undervalued virtue known as &ldquo;<b>gratitude</b>.&rdquo; It opens up a few biblical texts we otherwise may be prone to downplay. Here&rsquo;s the true story of thanksgiving in four stages. Created for Thanksgiving  This text comes from the JoS e-groups, and since it is important, I am posting the translation: This is advanced stuff, but it gives you the real steps of <b>Satanic</b> Rituals. The Standard Ritual on the JoS website is for everyone, but primarily for beginners - it prepares them for the advanced ritual, the importance&hellip;  All Friday the 13th&rsquo;s are high <b>satanic</b> days. All full-moon nights provide reason for major occult activity (easiest to move around without difficulty and without being detected). Holy week (Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday).  There are many times we are blessed by <b>Satan</b>. It is very important that we show our gratitude and acknowledge his gifts. For a Thanksgiving Ritual, this is a way to show appreciation, but the best way is to do some actual work for the Powers of Hell.  <b>Satanic</b> holy days are usually when <b>Satanic</b> Ritual Abuse (SRA) takes place. <b>Satanic</b> holiday dates change annually according to the regular calendar and differ from cult to cult.
