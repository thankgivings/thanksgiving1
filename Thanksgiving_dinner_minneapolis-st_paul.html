        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving dinner minneapolis-st paul Thanksgiving toddler class</strong></h2>
        <p>You can expect the end of <b>Thanksgiving</b> week to be crowded, especially on <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day and the day after, in November. I&#39;ve been at Disneyland on Thanksgiving Day and it was pretty crowded, especially in the morning.  Statistically speaking, crowds do drop <b>after</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> at <b>Disneyland</b>. This typically starts to some degree on that Saturday, with a sharper drop on <b>Sunday</b> and the following week. You can expect crowd levels to fall from 8/10 to 10/10 levels the week of <b>Thanksgiving</b> to 2/10 to 5/10 levels that next week.  Wondering which days of the week to visit <b>Disneyland</b> and <b>Disney</b> California Adventure for the lowest crowds? This guide covers which dates have the lowest and highest wait times, plus commentary about weekdays vs. weekends, Halloween &amp; Christmas seasons, how SoCal ticket deals impact daily attendance, and more.  Showing up at the parks prepared and knowing what to expect is the best way to ensure a successful Thanksgiving at <b>Disneyland</b>. Here are our top five tips to make sure you have the most magical Thanksgiving at Disneyland ever. 1. Make Your Disneyland Thanksgiving <b>Dining</b> <b>Reservations</b>  Thanksgiving crowds typically start arriving the Sunday beforehand, which would be November <b>24</b>, <b>2024</b>. They typically peak on Monday and Tuesday, with Wednesday and Thursday being slightly less busy. Tourist crowds depart over the weekend, meaning moderate crowds by Saturday, November 30, 2024.  The Sunday after Thanksgiving is often a <b>travel</b> <b>day</b> for people. Normally, we expect crowds to drop slightly on that day, but again, all weekends in fall are usually full for reservations, so we expect Thanksgiving weekend to book up early too.  Reservations for <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner at <b>Disneyland</b> went live as of Oct. 4, 2023. So we are expecting news to drop any minute ... so be ready to book! There are <b>Thanksgiving</b> day meals as well as a Pajama Party breakfast and Brunch (from Nov. 19 through Jan. 1) at Storytellers Cafe.  Seems the recommendation is to queue very early (6:45am). I may or may not be interested in getting up early and doing that (might want to take my time, enjoy room service breakfast, mosey on in later). With Genie +, being a single rider, and having DAS, how detrimental will it be to wait out some of the bottleneck and head in closer to 8am?  I understand wanting to enjoy a traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day meal, but be aware that dining reservations typically open up 60 days out for most dining locations at the <b>Disneyland</b> Resort. Availability may be limited and isn&#39;t guaranteed as this is a popular day and many locations featuring a holiday-inspired menu are snapped up quickly by other ... </p>        <p>Grilling thanksgiving turkey recipes. <a href="./821.html">Thanksgiving menu ideas appetizers</a>.
