        <p><b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>6</b>, <b>1941</b>, the House passed a joint resolution declaring the last Thursday in November to be the legal Thanksgiving Day. The Senate, however, amended the resolution establishing the holiday as the fourth Thursday, which would take into account those years when November has five Thursdays.  In <b>1941</b>, a Congressional Joint Resolution officially set the fourth Thursday of November as a national holiday for Thanksgiving. Today, Thanksgiving is a time when many families come together, and many churches are open for special services.  Learn how it has evolved from its religious roots <b>as</b> <b>Spanish</b> and English days of feasting and prayer to become the football-watching, parade-marching, gut-stuffing event it is today. English...  Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the fourth Thursday of <b>November</b>. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  Thanksgiving is a U.S. holiday celebrated each year at the end of <b>November</b>. Learn about the history of Thanksgiving, facts about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  The United States holiday of Thanksgiving is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall <b>of</b> <b>1621</b>.  The <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>holiday&#39;s</b> <b>history</b> in North America is rooted in English traditions dating from the Protestant Reformation. It also has aspects of a harvest festival, even though the harvest in New England occurs well before the late-November date on which the modern <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>holiday</b> is celebrated. [1] [2]  Thanksgiving Day became an official U.S. holiday in <b>1863</b>, and in 1942 the federal government designated the fourth Thursday in November as Thanksgiving.

Thanksgiving Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year.
