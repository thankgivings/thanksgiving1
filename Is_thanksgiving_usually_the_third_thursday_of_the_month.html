        <p>With the upcoming holiday, known by many as Thanksgiving but recognized by Native American communities as the National <b>Day</b> of <b>Mourning</b>, Peters and other Indigenous activists and scholars are...  On the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> of <b>November</b>, timed to the US Thanksgiving holiday, she and other members of the group United American Indians of New England (UAINE) gather in Plymouth,...  This <b>day</b>, also the federal holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, is known there by another name: National <b>Day</b> of <b>Mourning</b>. Those in Plymouth hear speeches, hold a protest and mourn for the millions of Indigenous people who died due to the genocidal tactics of European settlers. <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a holiday that creates a false narrative of American unity.  Organized by the United American Indians of New England in 1970, the fourth Thursday in November (<b>Thanksgiving</b>) is recognized as the National <b>Day</b> of <b>Mourning</b> for Native Americans and their allies. Many people gather at Cole&#39;s Hill in Plymouth for an organized rally and <b>day</b> of <b>mourning</b> on <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  As word spread of that outcome, so was born the National Day of Mourning, a sort of counter-commemoration that happens every <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> of <b>November</b>.  Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, this year&rsquo;s National <b>Day</b> of <b>Mourning</b> will look different. Kisha James and some others will still gather at Coles Hill at noon on <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> to make...  The National Day of Mourning is an annual demonstration, held on the fourth Thursday <b>in</b> <b>November</b>, that aims to educate the public about Native Americans in the United States, notably the Wampanoag and other tribes of the Eastern United States; dispel myths surrounding the Thanksgiving story in the United States; and raise awareness toward ...  While many historians and activists have worked to disrupt public memory as it relates to the imagined history of Thanksgiving, the true agency of the story lies in the hands of Indigenous communities, who recognize the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> of <b>November</b> as a National Day of Mourning.  In response to the historical misrepresentation of Native peoples, Wamsutta Frank James of the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) founded the &ldquo;National <b>Day</b> of <b>Mourning</b>&rdquo; in 1970. This <b>day</b> challenges the sanitized narrative of the 1621 harvest, often portrayed as the story of &ldquo;Indians&rdquo; welcoming pilgrims and sharing a meal together. </p>        <p>Restaurants serving thanksgiving dinner in tampa fl.
