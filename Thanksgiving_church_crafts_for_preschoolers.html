        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving church crafts for preschoolers Easy mexican recipes for thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>The <b>Mashpee</b> <b>Wampanoag</b> first encountered the Pilgrims who arrived on the Mayflower ship in 1620. They say much is missing from the often-told Thanksgiving story.  The first <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a <b>harvest</b> celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first Thanksgiving. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written.  Museums and historic sites in <b>Plymouth</b> and around the country are telling a more nuanced story about the origins of the holiday&mdash;one that goes far beyond the lasting legend of smiling Pilgrims and...  You&#39;ve probably heard <b>stories</b> about the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> - you know, <b>Pilgrims</b> and Native Americans coming together for a grand feast. Join us as we review the facts - and do a bit of myth-busting.  Americans are told the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> took place in 1621, when the <b>Pilgrim</b> settlers of Plymouth, Massachusetts, invited the Wampanoag to a harvest feast. The <b>story</b> goes the meal invite was to thank them for their help in planting crops, and that a warm friendship budded between the two people groups.  Pilgrims held their second <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebration in <b>1623</b> to mark the end of a long drought that had threatened the year&rsquo;s harvest and prompted Governor Bradford to call for a religious fast.  The <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoag shared a harvest feast, but it didn&#39;t happen the way you were likely taught in school. Every November, Americans gather around the table to celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> in ...  For American culture, the <b>story</b> of the <b>Pilgrims</b>, including their &ldquo;first <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; feast with the local Native Americans, has become the ruling creation narrative, celebrated each November along with turkey, pumpkin pie, and football games.  Though we&#39;re taught that the <b>Pilgrims</b> and Indians gathered at Plymouth for a feast <b>in</b> <b>1621</b>, the truth behind the first Thanksgiving is more complicated. Believed to be a calm, celebratory meal, the first Thanksgiving has been revered as one of the most iconic moments in America&#39;s early history. </p>        <p>Black olives matter thanksgiving.
