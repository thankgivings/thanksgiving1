        <p>Thanksgiving is a popular North American holiday that is central to the origin story of the United States. It is traditionally said to have begun with the Plymouth Thanksgiving in <b>1621</b>, but other Thanksgiving celebrations may have taken place earlier.  George Washington declared the first national Thanksgiving Day <b>on</b> <b>November</b> <b>26th</b>, <b>1789</b>, as a day of thanks and public prayer. This was seen as a way of uniting the young country. But Thanksgiving was mainly left up to the states until 1863, when Abraham Lincoln declared it a federal holiday.

Thanksgiving Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a <b>1621</b> harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  Thanksgiving is known by most Americans as &ldquo;<b>Turkey</b> <b>Day</b>&rdquo; because this is the most common entree prepared on the holiday. The family gathers in the kitchen early in the morning to first clean the turkey and then stuff it with a mixture of bread and vegetables which is referred to as &ldquo;stuffing.&rdquo;  Learn the history and <b>origin</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b>, including the symbols related to the holiday and facts about the Presidential Proclamation.  The United States holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  This <b>1623</b> festival appears to have been the origin of our Thanksgiving Day because it combined a religious and social celebration. Festivals of Thanksgiving were observed sporadically on a local level for more than 150 years.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> dates to the days of the early American colonists and carries a rich, yet controversial, history.
