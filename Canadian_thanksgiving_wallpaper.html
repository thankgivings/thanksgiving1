        <h2><strong>Canadian thanksgiving wallpaper Thanksgiving day 2024 japan</strong></h2>
        <p>This is <b>bread</b> to be thankful for, <b>John</b> <b>6</b>:25-36. 25 When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, &ldquo;Rabbi, when did you come here?&rdquo; 26 Jesus answered them, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, you are seeking me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves. 27 Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life ...  THE POWER OF THANKSGIVING. <b>John</b> <b>6</b>:1-13, 35. Thanksgiving comes from the Greek word Eucharist. Although not a common term amongst many modern evangelistic churches today it relates to one of the oldest experiences of Christian worship, the remembering and celebration of the Life, Death, and Resurrection of Christ.  I preached a Thanksgiving Day <b>sermon</b> on <b>John</b> <b>6</b>:23. This passage teaches us that thanksgiving is a time to praise God. Our prayers should be based on the Word of God. The Bible is clear that we should be thankful for everything that we have and be thankful for all the blessings we have received.  Jesus then began to teach them about true <b>bread</b>, not <b>bread</b> that will mold and decay, but <b>bread</b> that lives forever. And Jesus said that he is that <b>bread</b>. Jesus taught the people this simple truth: &ldquo; Feeding on Jesus brings eternal life. &rdquo; Scripture (<b>John</b> <b>6</b>:51-58) verse 51: Jesus had just spoken about the manna the Israelites ate in the ...  <b>John</b> <b>6</b>:25-35. 25 When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, &quot;Rabbi, when did you come here?&quot; 26 Jesus answered them, &quot;Very truly, I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves. 27 Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you.  Jn <b>6</b>:32 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that <b>bread</b> from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true <b>bread</b> from heaven. Jn <b>6</b>:33 For the <b>bread</b> of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. Jn <b>6</b>:34 Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this <b>bread</b>.  So as Jesus begins to describe this true <b>bread</b> from heaven that gives life to the world, your mouth begins to water. You imagine a glowing loaf cooked perfectly, <b>warm</b> and moist on the inside, with just enough crust on the outside. You join the chorus around you, &ldquo;Give us some of that <b>bread</b> Jesus! We want that always!&rdquo;  But they missed the point. Jesus didn&rsquo;t come to bring <b>bread</b>. He came to be <b>bread</b>. In his famous &ldquo;<b>Bread</b> of Life&rdquo; discourse in <b>John</b> <b>6</b>, Jesus turns the focus away from physical <b>bread</b> that satisfies hunger for a time and points us to the true, life giving <b>bread</b> that brings eternal joy &ndash; himself.  Then there was the miracle of understanding. The disciples never forgot what they had witnessed. The day after, <b>John</b> described a boat that touched ashore near the place where they ate the <b>bread</b> after the Lord gave thanks (<b>John</b> <b>6</b>:23). The spot was branded into their memories. They never forgot what had happened there and the lesson they had learned. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving proclamation thomas jefferson.
