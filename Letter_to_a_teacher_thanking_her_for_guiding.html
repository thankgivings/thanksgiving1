        <h2><strong>Letter to a teacher thanking her for guiding What in a thanksgiving dinner menu</strong></h2>
        <p>Of these holidays, <b>Thanksgiving </b>is by far the most popular among Yidden, with many keeping some semblance of observance, generally as a way of saying &lsquo;Thank You&rsquo; and showing a form of Hakaras HaTov to our host country.  The first and most significant issue in discussing whether it is halachic [acceptable according to Jewish law] to celebrate <b>Thanksgiving </b>is whether it is permissible to eat a <b>Thanksgiving </b>meal, with the classical foods that American tradition indicates one should eat at this meal: turkey and cranberry sauce. Among the authorities of the ...  &bull; In lieu of the <b>Todah</b> (Thanksgiving) Sacrifice that was offered by a grateful person during Temple times, there are those who recite the verses of the Torah that discuss the Todah Sacrifice.27 &bull; It is common to hold a festive meal in commemoration of Gâ€‘d&#39;s kindness.  <b>Thanksgiving </b>has since been observed annually as a national holiday across the United States. But our subject is defining how <b>Thanksgiving </b>observance is viewed by Halacha. Chukos HaGoyim? To answer this question, a little halachic background is needed.  Before any halachic analysis can be done, it is necessary to place the observance of the holiday of <b>Thanksgiving </b>in America in the proper historical context. The first <b>Thanksgiving </b>day celebration was held in response to the survival by the pilgrims of the particularly harsh winter of 1622/3.  Is it permissible to celebrate <b>Thanksgiving </b>according to Halacha? <b>Thanksgiving </b>is a civil holiday celebrated in North America. The point of <b>Thanksgiving </b>is to express gratitude for the autumn crops and express general gratitude to HaShem.  Pies and cobblers should be the last food consumed on <b>thanksgiving </b>and should be eaten before midnight. This is originally from Only Simachas.  Rav Yitzchok Hutner clearly forbade the celebration of <b>Thanksgiving </b>(heard from his student, Rabbi Yaakov Feitman), while Rav Moshe Feinstein and Rav Mordechai Gifter had more lenient approaches....  The prayer is reflective of the way many understand and experience <b>Thanksgiving</b>. A simple giving of thanks is also a way of connecting to God potentially reducing overall injustice. As it turns out, this year <b>Thanksgiving </b>coincides with erev Rosh Chodesh / Yom Kippur Katan. </p>        <p>Texas state commons thanksgiving schedule.
