        <h2><strong>Food recalls for thanksgiving Coloring thanksgiving turkey gravy recipe</strong></h2>
        <p>For American culture, the story of the <b>Pilgrims</b>, including their &ldquo;<b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; feast with the local Native Americans, has become the ruling creation narrative, <b>celebrated</b> each November along with turkey, pumpkin pie, and football games.  As was the custom in England, the Pilgrims celebrated <b>their</b> <b>harvest</b> <b>with</b> a festival. The 50 remaining colonists and roughly 90 Wampanoag tribesmen attended the &quot;First Thanksgiving.&quot; The major similarity between the first Jamestown settlers and the first Plymouth settlers was <b>great</b> <b>human</b> <b>suffering</b>.  Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the <b>first</b> recorded religious <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623. On this occasion,...  It&rsquo;s a simple story. The <b>Pilgrims</b> stepped off the Mayflower searching for religious freedom. The Native people they encountered welcomed them and helped them survive. To <b>celebrate</b> their friendship, they sat down together to a <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast. This is the traditional tale of the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  The United States holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast <b>celebrated</b> by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as <b>pilgrims</b>) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  More than 160 years after the 1621 feast, President George Washington declared Nov. 26, 1789, as a day of prayer and <b>thanksgiving</b>. <b>Thanksgiving</b> itself was not <b>celebrated</b> annually until 1863 when President Abraham Lincoln declared the last Thursday of November as <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day to <b>celebrate</b> the Union Army&rsquo;s victory at Gettysburg.  That&#39;s why many Native Americans and others mark <b>Thanksgiving</b> as a solemn day of <b>remembrance</b> instead of <b>celebration</b>. Here&#39;s what really went down after the plates were cleared in Plymouth,...  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a harvest celebration held by the <b>pilgrims</b> of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written.  The <b>first</b> national <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day <b>did</b> not invoke the <b>Pilgrims</b> at all. In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln declared a <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day on the last Thursday of November, looking to reconcile a ... </p>        <p>An old fashioned thanksgiving primewire.
