        <h2><strong>What thanksgiving food has the most calories Youtube adele thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Depending on local customs, harvest festivities are held in <b>September</b> <b>or</b> <b>October</b>, known as the Thanksgiving festival. Modern Harvest activities include singing hymns, praying, and adorning churches with baskets of fruit and food.  Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in <b>October</b> and November in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  The colonists of the Massachusetts Bay Company, not the Plymouth Colony, decreed a day of <b>thanksgiving </b>for their victory which is often interpreted by modern-day Native Americans as the basis for the <b>Thanksgiving </b>holiday which many observe as a Day of Mourning and reflection.  Harvest <b>Festival</b> celebrates the time of year when crops have been gathered from the field and people can reflect and show gratitude for the food that they have. It dates back a long time in...  The tradition of celebrating Harvest <b>Festival</b> in churches as we know it today began in 1843, when the Reverend Robert Hawker invited parishioners to a special thanksgiving service for the harvest at his church at Morwenstow in Cornwall.  Every autumn, Canadian and American families gather for a day centred around community, food and giving <b>thanks</b> &ndash; the day of Thanksgiving. Where did this holiday come from and how is it celebrated today?  <b>Thanksgiving </b>2024 falls on Thursday 28 November. While it&#39;s an American holiday, there are plenty of opportunities for American expats, former US residents and general food/party lovers to...  <b>Thanksgiving </b>is a holiday celebrated <b>in </b>America on the fourth Thursday of November each year. While Canada also observe <b>Thanksgiving</b>, it is celebrated <b>in </b>October there. <b>Thanksgiving </b>dates all...  What Americans like to pretend Thanksgiving is in honour of is when, in 1621, English settlers (the Pilgrims) in Plymouth, Massachusetts, had a three-day <b>festival</b> to celebrate the first successful harvest since arriving in the New World. </p>        <p>Happy thanksgiving to friends funny.
