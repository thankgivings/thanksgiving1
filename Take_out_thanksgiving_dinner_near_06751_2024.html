        <h2><strong>Take out thanksgiving dinner near 06751 2024 Federal government day after thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>It&rsquo;s one of the strangest holiday traditions in late 19th and early 20th century <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>City</b>. On Thanksgiving day, kids (and often adults as well) used to dress up in costume (cowboys, pirates, and princesses were big) or in their most threadbare clothes and go door to door in the neighborhood, asking, anything for Thanksgiving ?  Through the 1930s <b>New</b> York City schools along with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children openly discouraged the children from Thanksgiving <b>begging</b>. The Boys Club offered a turkey prize to the child with the best costume at a party they held, instead of asking for alms in the street.  O&rsquo;Neill (Loftus at the time) remembers the <b>custom</b> well. Where she grew up in Bedford-Stuyvesant, all of the kids dressed as hobos and they spent the morning of Thanksgiving Day carousing the neighborhood &ldquo;begging&rdquo; for food and money from their neighbors. THE HISTORY  Leading up to Thanksgiving, you can use the code &quot;THANKSGIVING&quot; <b>for</b> 22% off your Adventures: All-Access membership! Follow this link: https://www.drivethruadventures.com/offers/wn2di2PC... Here are some unique Thanksgiving traditions that started in the streets of New York&hellip;  Thought to have originated in Irish and other immigrant neighborhoods in New <b>York</b>, Ragamuffin Day took off almost as soon as Abraham Lincoln declared Thanksgiving to be a national holiday in...  The kids sometimes used burnt cork on their faces or wore masks to make themselves look more like ragamuffins while <b>begging</b> for change (see 1911 Thanksgiving photo, &ldquo;Scrambling for Pennies,&rdquo; in the G.C. Bain collection).  When I was growing up in Weehawken, N.J., in the 40&#39;s, the &quot;Anything for Thanksgiving?&quot; greeting was very much an established <b>custom</b>. My husband, who grew up on 148th Street in Manhattan in the...  Known colloquially in New York City <b>as</b> Ragamuffin Day, the children would go out on the streets and ask, &ldquo;Anything for Thanksgiving?&rdquo; They would be rewarded with candies, fruits or even pennies. Over time, the tradition would expand as the children dressed up as more than just hobos and vagrants.  How did <b>begging</b> start as a Thanksgiving tradition? Well, it&rsquo;s thought that <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> somehow combined Evacuation Day street parties with an old, New England, Thanksgiving <b>custom</b>.
