        <h2><strong>Are the banks closed on the friday after thanksgiving Elementary thanksgiving episode</strong></h2>
        <p>We first approach God with worship and adoration. Our sense of God&rsquo;s holiness leads us to repentance. Hearing the assurance of pardon leads naturally to <b>thanksgiving</b>, and so on. There is a theological logic to this organization of a worship service that is better than a &ldquo;list approach.&rdquo;  The prayer, which is also known as the Great Thanksgiving or the <b>eucharistic</b> <b>prayer</b>, recapitulates salvation history. It praises and thanks God the Creator for the work of Jesus the Savior, and then asks the Holy Spirit to take us up into the life of God.  <b>Prayers</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b> and Intercession August 30, 2020 We offer our <b>prayers</b> together now, uniting our voices with Christ, who perfects our <b>prayers</b>. Come, almighty King, and help us your name to sing, for you are a God of love. Come, incarnate Word, and make known your wonders to our souls, for you are a God of grace. Come, holy  Loving God, we offer these <b>prayers</b>, joining our voices to the great chorus of those who sing your praise and depend on you alone. We long for that day when all your children will live in your peace and praise your name. Until that day, give us sturdy patience and enduring hope, rooted only in Jesus, in whose name we pray. Amen.  With voices united our <b>praises</b> we offer; our songs of <b>thanksgiving</b> to you we now raise. You crown the year with your bounty; your wagon tracks overflow with richness. Your strong arm will guide us, our God is beside us. To you, our great Redeemer, fore&#39;er be praise!  Great are you, Lord, and greatly to be praised; your greatness is unsearchable. (Psalm <b>145</b>) God, we praise you and we thank you. We thank you for graciously welcoming us to worship you, whether at home or in the Calvin Church sanctuary. We thank you for warmer spring weather and the changing seasons again this year.  Let us <b>give</b> <b>thanks</b> to the <b>Lord</b> <b>our</b> <b>God</b>. It is right to give our thanks and praise. We do indeed praise you, eternal God, For out of your thought you spoke the world into spinning beauty. After scooping together a little earth, you animated humans with your heart&rsquo;s breath.  taken from The Lord&#39;s Supper Liturgy of the <b>Christian Reformed Church</b> of North America, 1994  <b>Prayer</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b> and Intercession January 31, 2021 Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, we praise you. You are wonderful &ndash; you are wonderful in the ways that we know you &ndash; we know that you are strong, gentle, creative, loving, righteous, perfect, and kind. And you are wonderful in the ways that we do not know you, or at least do not fully </p>        <p>Thanksgiving hand wreath. <i>Are the banks closed on the friday after thanksgiving</i>.
