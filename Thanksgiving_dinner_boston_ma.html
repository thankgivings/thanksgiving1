        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving dinner boston ma Cannon beach restaurants thanksgiving 2024</strong></h2>
        <p>To put it simply, the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> wasn&rsquo;t some grand event planned months in advance. The Pilgrims had just survived a brutal winter and a difficult harvest.  Historical Records About <b>Foods</b> at the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. In a letter dated December 11, 1621, Mayflower passenger Edward Winslow offers some of the only historical information about what they ate at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. After noting that the colonists had harvested a good crop &quot;Indian corn&quot; and an acceptable crop of barley but lost their ...  According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well. <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> Menu Fowl  What They (Likely) Did Have at the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Venison; Fowl (geese and duck) Corn; Nuts (walnuts, chestnuts, beechnuts) Shellfish; So venison was a major ingredient, as well as fowl, but that likely included geese and ducks. Turkeys are a possibility, but were not a common <b>food</b> in that time. Pilgrims grew onions and herbs.  Since the historic meal in 1621, <b>Thanksgiving</b> traditions have changed and evolved with American culture. From turkey and stuffing to potatoes and pies, we know what dishes to expect at our holiday tables today, but you might be surprised to learn what <b>foods</b> the Pilgrims and Wampanoag brought to the table and what didn&rsquo;t make the cut.  Only 5 percent of this <b>food</b> was served at the <b>first Thanksgiving</b>. There are only two surviving documents that reference the original <b>Thanksgiving</b> harvest meal. They describe a feast of freshly killed deer, assorted wildfowl, a bounty of cod and bass, and flint, a native variety of corn harvested by the Native Americans, which was eaten as corn ...  There&rsquo;s a good chance the Pilgrims and Wampanoag did in fact eat turkey as part of that very <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Wild turkey was a common <b>food</b> source for people who settled Plymouth. In the days prior to the celebration, the colony&rsquo;s governor sent four men to go &ldquo;fowling&rdquo;&mdash;that is, to hunt for birds. Did they come back with any turkey?  Like many of the <b>foods</b> eaten at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, American chestnuts were probably prepared multiple ways for the occasion. Ground chestnuts, along with walnuts, beechnuts, and acorns commonly served as thickeners in stew, or sobaheg, in the Wampanoag language. Another possibility is that chestnuts were used for stuffing inside roasted birds.  Today, the traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner includes any number of dishes: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, candied yams, cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie. </p>        <p>Funny thanksgiving men.
