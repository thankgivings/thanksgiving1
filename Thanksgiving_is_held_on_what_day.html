        <p>Implement my tips below to manage through <b>Thanksgiving without your </b>loved one and feel their consoling company on any day: Talk to them. Before stepping out for <b>Thanksgiving </b>dinner, speak out loud to <b>your </b>beloved. Conjure their memory in <b>your </b>mind and tell them exactly how you feel.  The first year after losing someone, there is a list of firsts: the first Thanksgiving <b>without</b> them at the table, the first birthday or anniversary that passes.
