        <h2><strong>Restaurants in sf open for thanksgiving Thanksgiving food 5 letters</strong></h2>
        <p>During John Adams&rsquo;s presidency, <b>Thanksgiving</b> was celebrated on Wednesday, May 9, 1798 and <b>Thursday</b>, April 25, 1799 . Our next president, Thomas Jefferson, chose not to declare an official day of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, recognizing that the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prevented him from mandating a day of prayer ( Monticello ).  Here&#39;s what to know about why our holiday meant to give thanks is always celebrated on the fourth Thursday of <b>November</b>.  Why is Thanksgiving always on a Thursday? If you&#39;ve ever wondered why Thanksgiving is on a Thursday instead <b>of</b> a Friday, you aren&#39;t alone. It seems obvious to grant everyone an <b>automatic</b> <b>three</b>-day weekend! Surprisingly, this tradition dates back to <b>Puritan</b> times.  For two years two days were celebrated as <b>Thanksgiving</b> - the President and part of the nation celebrated it on the second to last <b>Thursday</b> in November, while the rest of the country celebrated it the following week. To end the confusion, Congress decided to set a fixed-date for the holiday.  Why is Thanksgiving on the fourth <b>Thursday</b> in November? (In 2024, it&#39;s the LATEST this holiday can be held). What were the real reasons both Washington and Lincoln proclaimed a day of <b>Thanksgiving</b>? (No, it&#39;s not about a Pilgrim feast.) Get the facts.  The first official proclamation of a national <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday didn&rsquo;t come until 1863, when President Abraham Lincoln called for an annual <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebration on the final <b>Thursday</b>...  In 2024, we celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> on November 28. It always falls on the fourth <b>Thursday</b> of the month, a rule set by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1941.  We know that <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is in November and we celebrate on Thursdays, but some wonder why that is the case.  By federal law, Americans have celebrated <b>Thanksgiving</b> on the fourth <b>Thursday</b> in November since 1942, but numerous other dates were designated in the past. It is believed that America&rsquo;s first <b>Thanksgiving</b>, actually a harvest feast that brought together 53 Pilgrims and some 90 Native Americans, occurred in the fall of 1621.
