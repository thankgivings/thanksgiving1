        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving dinner in a cake Restaurants in new hampshire open on thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>In the modern consciousness, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is strongly associated with the near-mythological story of the Pilgrims at Plymouth (the English colonists) and their Wampanoag Indian neighbors, who shared a meal to <b>celebrate</b> the harvest in 1621. However, days of <b>thanksgiving</b> on a variety of occasions have been celebrated throughout American history.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is usually celebrated with a family meal. Beginning in the 2010s, a new tradition has emerged to also <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> with a meal with friends, as a separate event on a different day or an alternate event on <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day. This is referred to as Friendsgiving. [65]  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a U.S. holiday celebrated each year at the end of November. Learn about the history of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, <b>facts</b> about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  <b>Facts</b> like these help shed light on <b>why</b> many Indigenous Americans observe a different holiday on the exact same day as <b>Thanksgiving</b>&mdash;the National Day of Mourning.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> eat turkey on <b>Thanksgiving</b>? Although it is often assumed that today&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> menu originated in an event commonly referred to as the &ldquo;first <b>Thanksgiving</b>,&quot; there is no indication that turkey was served at the meal shared between Pilgrim settlers at Plymouth colony and local Wampanoag Indians in late 1621.  Here are interesting <b>facts</b> about <b>why</b> and how <b>we</b> <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in the U.S. to entertain your family at the holiday table. ... The British don&rsquo;t officially <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, but ...  The legend of the American <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday is said to have been based on a feast of <b>thanksgiving</b> in the early days of the American colonies almost 400 years ago. The tale as it is told in grade schools is a legend, a mythologized version that downplays some of the bleaker history of how <b>Thanksgiving</b> became an American national holiday.  Plymouth Colony &amp; First <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The Plymouth Colony was founded by a group comprised of Puritan separatists (the pilgrims) and Anglican settlers who had been hired or invited to join them by the merchant adventurer Thomas Weston (l. 1584 - c. 1647) who secured them a patent from the Virginia Company of London and rented them the Mayflower to establish a profitable colony in Virginia. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving activities for grade 1.
