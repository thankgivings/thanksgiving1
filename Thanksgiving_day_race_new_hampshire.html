        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving day race new hampshire Thanksgiving jumpsuit</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> is a federal holiday in the <b>United States</b> celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. [2] . Outside the <b>United States</b>, it is sometimes called American <b>Thanksgiving</b> to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  In the United States, Thanksgiving Day is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in <b>November</b>, as specified in a joint resolution passed by Congress in 1941 and a proclamation issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1942.  The <b>United States</b> holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  It is believed that America&rsquo;s first <b>Thanksgiving</b>, actually a harvest feast that brought together 53 Pilgrims and some 90 Native Americans, occurred in the fall of 1621. Beginning in 1668, the holiday was celebrated on November 25, but that lasted only a few years.  Thanksgiving as a national holiday owes its origins to <b>Sarah</b> <b>Josepha</b> <b>Hale</b>, who lobbied Abraham Lincoln&mdash;and wrote &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;  American <b>Thanksgiving</b> stemmed from English harvest traditions. <b>Thanksgiving</b> in North America is rooted in traditions that date to the English Reformation. Days of <b>Thanksgiving</b> had become more popular following the reign of Henry VIII, in reaction to the large number of existing Catholic religious holidays.  That&#39;s why many Native <b>Americans</b> and others mark <b>Thanksgiving</b> as a solemn day of remembrance instead of celebration. Here&#39;s what really went down after the plates were cleared in Plymouth, Mass.  Most Americans are familiar with the Pilgrim&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Feast of 1621, but few realize that it was not the first festival of its kind in North America. Long before Europeans set foot in the Americas, native peoples sought to insure a good harvest with dances and rituals such as the Green Corn Dance of the Cherokees.  Learn how it has evolved from its religious roots as Spanish and English days of feasting and prayer to become the football-watching, parade-marching, gut-stuffing event it is today.
