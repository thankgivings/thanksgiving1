        <p>Learn how it has evolved from its religious roots as <b>Spanish</b> and English days of feasting and prayer to become the football-watching, parade-marching, gut-stuffing event it is today. English...  In the modern consciousness, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is strongly associated with the near-mythological story of the Pilgrims at Plymouth (the English colonists) and their Wampanoag Indian neighbors, who shared a meal to celebrate the harvest in 1621.  <b>The </b>United States holiday <b>of Thanksgiving </b>is generally understood to be inspired by <b>the </b>harvest feast celebrated by <b>the </b>citizens <b>of </b>Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and <b>the </b>Native Americans <b>of the </b>Wampanoag Confederacy <b>in the </b>fall <b>of </b>1621.  Thanksgiving Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a <b>1621</b> harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a U.S. holiday celebrated each year at the end of November. Learn about the history of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, facts about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a popular North <b>American</b> holiday that is central to the <b>origin</b> story of the United States. It is traditionally said to have begun with the Plymouth <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621, but other <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebrations may have taken place earlier.  Most Americans are familiar with the Pilgrim&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Feast of 1621, but few realize that it was not the first festival of its kind in North <b>America</b>. Long before Europeans set foot in the Americas, native peoples sought to insure a good harvest with dances and rituals such as the Green Corn Dance of the Cherokees.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. [2] . Outside the United States, it is sometimes called <b>American</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  In <b>1863</b>, President Abraham Lincoln declared National Thanksgiving Day in the United States, to be held on the last Thursday of each November. The day of celebration, family get-togethers, parades, and feasts that we know today largely came about due to the tireless lobbying of Sarah Josepha Hale. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving messages for social media.
