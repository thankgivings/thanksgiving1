        <h2><strong>Traditional african american thanksgiving menu 1950s Thanksgiving national holiday when</strong></h2>
        <p>{c} Enter <b>into</b> <b>his gates</b> with <b>thanksgiving</b>, and <b>into</b> <b>his</b> courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless <b>his</b> name. (c) He shows that God will not be worshipped, but by those means which he has appointed.  Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, And into his courts with praise: Be thankful unto him, and bless his name (Psalm <b>100:4</b> KJV) It is the rare Christian who has not used the words of this verse or at least heard them in a sermon.  Enter His gates with thanksgiving, And His courtyards with praise. Give thanks to Him, bless His name. - What is the meaning of Psalm <b>100:4</b>?  Let us enter <b>into</b> <b>His</b> <b>gates</b> with <b>thanksgiving</b> and <b>His</b> courts with praise. Let us give thanks to Him and bless <b>His</b> name, for the Lord is good, <b>His</b> lovingkindness is everlasting, and <b>His</b> faithfulness endures throughout all generations.  &ldquo;Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with <b>praise</b>; give thanks to him and praise his name&rdquo; (Psalm <b>100:4</b> NIV). Psalm 100 is credited to King David, although some biblical scholars believe various people wrote the book of Psalms.  Enter into His gates with thanksgiving: &ldquo;<b>Publicly</b> <b>worship</b> <b>God</b>; and when ye come to the house of prayer, be thankful that you have such a privilege; and when you enter his courts, praise him for the permission.&rdquo; (Clarke)  The key verse here is verse 4, which says, &ldquo;<b>Enter into his gates with thanksgiving</b>, and <b>into his </b>courts <b>with </b>praise: be thankful unto him, and bless <b>his </b>name.&rdquo; How do we <b>enter into </b>the presence of God? In Psalm 100, we see the picture of the <b>gates </b>and the courts of the tabernacle from the Old Testament.  The Meaning of &#39;Enter His Gates with Thanksgiving&#39; In our psalm today, the word &ldquo;enter&rdquo; means to <b>come</b>, <b>bring</b> <b>in</b>, <b>gather</b>, <b>or</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b>. God is the one inviting us to enter His gates....  Enter into his gates with thanksgiving &mdash; <b>Publicly</b> <b>worship</b> <b>God</b>; and when ye come to the house of prayer, be thankful that you have such a privilege; and when you enter his courts, praise him for the permission. </p>        <p><a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/thanksgiving1/639.html">Thanksgiving song for toddlers</a>.
