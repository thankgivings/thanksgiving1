        <p>It&#39;s called kinrōkanshahi <b>勤労感謝の日</b> （ きんろうかんしゃひ ） 勤労感謝の日, or Labor Thanksgiving Day, and it&#39;s a national holiday. It has the same roots as Thanksgiving here in the US &ndash; it was once a fall harvest festival, but has since changed in meaning.  Labor Thanksgiving Day (勤労感謝の日, Kinrō Kansha no Hi) is a national holiday in Japan, celebrated annually <b>on</b> <b>November</b> <b>23rd</b>. This day is dedicated to honouring and giving thanks for the hard work and contributions of workers, as well as appreciating the fruits of their labour.  Japan, a country rich in tradition and culture, offers a unique holiday known as Labor Thanksgiving Day, <b>or</b> Kinrō Kansha no Hi. Celebrated annually <b>on</b> <b>November</b> <b>23rd</b>, this day is dedicated to honoring the hard work and contributions of laborers across the nation.  In Japan, this holiday is <b>勤労感謝の日</b> (きんろうかんしゃのひ), or &ldquo;Labor Thanksgiving Day.&rdquo; In this article, you&rsquo;ll learn how the Japanese show 感謝 (かんしゃ), or &ldquo;appreciation,&rdquo; on this special day, as well as the holiday&rsquo;s origins.  In Japan, <b>November</b> <b>23</b> is observed, officially since 1948, as a day off in respect to what the name literally says: &quot;thanks for giving&quot;. It is in reality an older tradition. This &quot;Labor Thanksgiving Day&quot;, as it is called today, was respected as early as November 678.  Thanksgiving in Japanese is called &lsquo;<b>Kinro</b> Kansha no Hi&rsquo;, which formally means Labor Thanksgiving Day. Unlike US Thanksgiving, which is celebrated on the third Thursday of November no matter the date, Japanese Thanksgiving always falls on the 23rd of November , or, if this is a Sunday, the following Monday.  <b>Labor</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> (Kinro Kansha no Hi in <b>Japanese</b>) is actually a modern name for an ancient ritual called Niinamesai (Harvest Festival). In the ritual, the Emperor makes the season&#39;s first offering of freshly harvested rice to the gods and then partakes of the rice himself.  Labor Thanksgiving Day, <b>or</b> Kinrō Kansha no Hi, highlights Japan&rsquo;s deep appreciation for workers and their contributions.

Incidentally, Japan has its own version of Thanksgiving, Kinro Kansha no Hi, or Labor Thanksgiving Day.
