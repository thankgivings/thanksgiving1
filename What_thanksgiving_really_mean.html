        <h2><strong>What thanksgiving really mean Thanksgiving content selection</strong></h2>
        <p>The tradition of playing professional and <b>high</b> <b>school</b> football games on <b>Thanksgiving</b> goes pretty far back as well. According to CBS, the Detroit Lions have been hosting <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day games since the 1930s, when the team&rsquo;s then-owner thought a holiday game would increase attendance.  The United States holiday of Thanksgiving is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of <b>1621</b>.  This self-paced lesson provides <b>historical</b> context for <b>Thanksgiving</b> and presents students with writing-based activities. This is an activity that students can complete, or it can be assigned as a take-home activity (pending computer and Internet access) for family participation.  Learn how <b>Thanksgiving</b> became a national holiday. Each educational video on the history of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is paired with three extension activities to use in your classroom.  Students will research the history of <b>Thanksgiving</b> based on the perspective of the Native Americans and the Pilgrims and then interview each other to learn about each story.  As <b>high school </b>students learn about American <b>history </b>and culture, it is important <b>for </b>them to learn about the <b>history </b>and traditions <b>of Thanksgiving</b>. Teachers can use a variety <b>of </b>resources to teach students about <b>Thanksgiving</b>, including historical documents, videos, and books.  Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the <b>1621</b> harvest gathering, the first recorded religious Thanksgiving Day in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623. On this occasion,...  With <b>Thanksgiving</b> fast approaching, educators are grappling with how to teach their students about the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> in ways that honor the spirit of the holiday and are historically accurate and responsible.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, observed in <b>2024</b> on <b>Thursday</b>, <b>November</b> 28, honors a 1621 feast between Plymouth colonists and the Wampanoag people. </p>        <p>Hotel del thanksgiving buffet.
