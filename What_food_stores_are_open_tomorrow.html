        <h2><strong>What food stores are open tomorrow Funny turkey thanksgiving meme</strong></h2>
        <p>Disney <b>World</b> offers a wide variety of dining options with special Thanksgiving menus, catering to every taste and preference. Liberty Tree Tavern (Magic Kingdom): Enjoy a classic Thanksgiving feast with turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, and all the beloved trimmings in a cozy, colonial-style setting.  Happy <b>Thanksgiving</b>, everyone! We&rsquo;re thankful for a lot this year, and we&rsquo;re celebrating in Disney <b>World</b>. Hello from Disney World! Thanksgiving is notoriously a busy travel day for people across the country. So, how do the crowds <b>compare</b> in Disney <b>World</b>? <b>Come</b> with us to Magic Kingdom to find out!  Is Disney World crowded on <b>Thanksgiving</b>? <b>Absolutely</b>, <b>emphatically</b> <b>yes</b>. Although the Central Florida resort isn&rsquo;t as busy for Thanksgiving as it is around Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s, it still gets incredibly packed, particularly on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.  If you&rsquo;re visiting Walt Disney <b>World</b> for <b>Thanksgiving</b> 2024 and are looking for last-minute restaurant ideas, avoiding holiday <b>crowds</b>, etc., we&rsquo;ve got you covered. Here we answer frequently asked questions, info, and tips for avoiding Thanksgiving week <b>crowds</b>.  Major holidays are miserably <b>crowded</b> at Disney. All but the highest AP tier is blocked out, which tells you the crowd levels they anticipate. I think high crowds like that are awful and completely ruin the experience, but clearly enough people aren&#39;t bothered, or those crowds wouldn&#39;t be there.  We headed to Magic Kingdom a little <b>after</b> <b>7AM</b>. Here&rsquo;s what the entrance crowds looked like &mdash; honestly, that&rsquo;s not too bad at all. When we arrived on Main Street, U.S.A. at around 7:20AM, we noticed that the Early Entry crowds had arrived.  Is Thanksgiving Weekend Busy at Disney <b>World</b>? One of the main questions I get is just how busy is Disney during Thanksgiving? If you&rsquo;ve never visited any of the parks during a major (and sometimes minor) holiday, then you&rsquo;ll be taken aback by the high crowd levels.  This crowd report shares recent wait time data, the degree to which there was a post-holiday hangover, and thoughts on what&rsquo;s likely to happen next with attendance this week and in early December 2021 at Walt Disney <b>World</b>. Thanksgiving being an insanely busy week should be unsurprising.  Thanksgiving at Disney <b>World</b> brings in extra <b>crowds</b>, which means restaurant queues will also be extra long. You&#39;ll save time waiting in line for food if you eat during off-peak times. Eat an early breakfast and have an early lunch at 11 a.m. Alternatively, eat a big breakfast and have a late lunch. </p>        <p>Survivor 2024 thanksgiving.
