        <h2><strong>Hotels for thanksgiving plans What time does macdonalds close on thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>There is not <b>a</b> National day of Thanksgiving in Australia as there is in the US, where this is a public holiday. Australia Day is held on the 26th January each year, honouring the date when the British flag was raised at Sydney Cove by Arthur Phillip.  While a culturally significant holiday, <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>has</b> a <b>dark</b> history. As both Australia and the US confront their difficult pasts around Indigenous people, we explore whether there is an appropriate way to mark the spirit of this harvest festival.  There are two significant national days, <b>Australia</b> Day (26 January) and Anzac Day (25 April), which are nationwide public holidays. When a public holiday occurs on a Friday or Monday, the three-day period is colloquially known as a &quot;long weekend&quot;.  In <b>Australia</b>, <b>Thanksgiving</b> was started after being brought over by whaling ships from America. In Canada, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is held in October and is used to show thankfulness at the end of the harvest season. Grenada&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>holiday</b> isn&rsquo;t related at all to thankfulness or harvests. Instead, it is held on October 25, the same day that a U ...  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a <b>holiday</b> traditionally associated with the United States, celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. However, in <b>Australia</b>, while it isn&rsquo;t a public <b>holiday</b>, many people embrace the spirit of gratitude and gather with loved ones to celebrate.  <b>Australia</b> celebrates a number of public <b>holidays</b> throughout the year when banks, offices and some shops are closed. If you are planning to travel to <b>Australia</b> during these peak periods it&#39;s wise to book interstate flights, tours and accommodation well in advance, to avoid missing out.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is not an officially recognized public <b>holiday</b> in <b>Australia</b>, and as such, it <b>does</b> not <b>have</b> a designated date on the Australian calendar. Unlike in the United States, where <b>Thanksgiving</b> falls on the fourth Thursday of November, Australians do not observe this tradition as a nationwide celebration.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is <b>a</b> public <b>holiday</b> in all states and territories of Australia. Most businesses and organizations are closed on this day. People usually spend the day with family and friends. Popular activities include attending special church services, sharing meals and exchanging gifts.  As a religious festival, Australia sometimes has harvest and thanksgiving church services, but most <b>don</b>&rsquo;<b>t</b> celebrate the Thanksgiving <b>holiday</b>. Thanksgiving is an annual national holiday in the United States of America and Canada that celebrates the harvest and other blessings of the past year. </p>        <p><a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/thanksgiving1/150.html">Hat ideas for thanksgiving</a>.
