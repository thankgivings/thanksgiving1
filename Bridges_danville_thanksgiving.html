        <p>The <b>speech</b> that James was set to deliver at the celebration was <b>censored</b> because it was not in line with the mythological story celebration organizers were set on sharing. James declined to deliver a scripted <b>speech</b> at the celebration, and instead the suppressed <b>speech</b> was delivered at the first National Day of Mourning.  Plymouth Colony &amp; First <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The Plymouth Colony was founded by a group comprised of Puritan separatists (the pilgrims) and Anglican settlers who had been hired or invited to join them by the merchant adventurer Thomas Weston (l. 1584 - c. 1647) who secured them a patent from the Virginia Company of London and rented them the Mayflower to establish a profitable colony in Virginia.  Kisha James and some others will still gather at Coles Hill at noon on <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day to make <b>speeches</b>, which will be live streamed. ... Now, <b>350</b> <b>years</b> later, it is the beginning of a new ...  The censorship angered local Native people and helped spark the creation in 1970 of the National Day of Mourning &mdash; a gathering held every <b>Thanksgiving</b> on Cole&rsquo;s Hill in Plymouth to honor ...

It was the beginning of a new life for the Pilgrims. Now, <b>350</b> <b>years</b> later it is a beginning of a new determination for the original American: the American Indian.&rdquo;  Speaking of persecution and murder brings me to the second First <b>Thanksgiving</b>&mdash;the one in 1637 that occurred near the Mystic River and involved the slaughter of at least 700 Pequot Indians. This is the real First <b>Thanksgiving</b>, the one so-named by the leader of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. As Mitchel Cohen relates (emphasis mine):  Some <b>350</b> <b>years</b> on, he refused to be silenced about the treatment of his people since the landing of the Mayflower. He had been invited to a <b>Thanksgiving</b> state dinner to mark the anniversary of the Mayflower&rsquo;s sailing, as part of a celebration that embraced the misleading schoolbook narrative of the Pilgrims&rsquo; relationship with the Wampanoag ...  It was the beginning of a new life for the Pilgrims. Now, <b>350</b> <b>years</b> later it is a beginning of a new determination for the original American: the American Indian. There are some factors concerning the Wampanoags and other Indians across this vast nation. We now have <b>350</b> <b>years</b> of experience living amongst the white man.
