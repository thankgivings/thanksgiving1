And, back <b>in</b> <b>1621</b>, wild turkeys were also likely part of the first Thanksgiving, but there were also other main dishes, like deer, duck, and goose.  Why exactly <b>the </b>Turkey has been <b>the </b>star <b>of </b>&ldquo;Turkey Day&rdquo; since at least <b>the </b>mid-19th century <b>is </b>a matter <b>of </b>much debate, particularly given <b>the </b>consensus amongst historians that <b>the </b>Pilgrims and... </p>        <p>Turkey thanksgiving or christmas.
