        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving celebration in usa Butler and bailey thanksgiving hours</strong></h2>
        <p>Source: WEB [prokerala.com | Photo: Mohammed Jafer/ANS] The United States is not the only country with a &ldquo;<b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; celebration. Personally, I do not view <b>Thanksgiving</b> as a religious holiday&mdash;at least not one that is specific to Islam or Christianity (or any other religion).  In reflecting about <b>Thanksgiving</b>, we must ask ourselves, as <b>Muslims</b>, how should we process this and how do we help our children identify with what&rsquo;s going on in our country at this time? In examining the practices that occur during <b>Thanksgiving</b>, we find that food, family, and giving are a major part of this holiday.  Any <b>Muslims</b> that <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> instead of fasting or focus on Eld or mixing <b>Thanksgiving</b> and Eld is commiting sin. This article is not really conveying the real truth behind <b>Thanksgiving</b> either. Allah mentions only two festivals or holidays in the Quran. A <b>muslim</b> must reject Tagoot even if they pratice non islamic holidays in his or ...  Although Thanksgiving is not a religious holiday or observance and is not commemorated as such, Muslims in America are naturally drawn to this holiday because of <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>gratitude</b> and <b>service</b> <b>that</b> it <b>embodies</b>. This American spirit of giving thanks is actually enshrined in Islam.  New Muslims should understand that celebrating thanksgiving is not the sixth pillar of <b>Islam</b> or the seventh article of faith. If you decide not to participate, it is up to you. We are talking about cases in which you are invited to a family gathering.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is one of those celebrations that are very close to Islamic teachings. Being grateful to the creator for the blessings He had bestowed upon us [3] and also thanking other people for what they did for us, is one of the encouraged manners in Islam.  Salafi scholars take that since their ancestors never celebrated things like birthdays, anniversaries, <b>Thanksgiving</b>, etc., even those that are not religious celebrations must all be categorized...  One question I&#39;m often asked, as a Muslim, is whether I celebrate Thanksgiving. Others wonder this because they know I do not <b>celebrate</b> <b>holidays</b> such as <b>Christmas</b>, <b>Easter</b> and...  1- A <b>Muslim</b> is allowed to <b>celebrate</b> any national occasion as long as it does not include any rituals that violate Shariah rulings. 2- So, a <b>Muslim</b> in America can share his family members celebrating <b>Thanksgiving</b> providing that he does not participate in any non-Islamic rituals or have any prohibited (haram) foods or drinks. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving day dresses toddlers.
