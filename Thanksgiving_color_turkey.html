        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving color turkey What are some good thanksgiving desserts</strong></h2>
        <p>Canadians celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> on the second Monday in October, while <b>Thanksgiving</b> in the United States is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November. When is <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>in Canada</b>? In 2025, <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>in Canada</b> is Monday, October 13. Upcoming Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Dates</b>:  Date of Celebration. U.S. Thanksgiving: Celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. For example: 2024: November 28; 2025: November 27; 2026: November 26; Canadian Thanksgiving: Celebrated on the second Monday of <b>October</b>, which coincides with the Canadian harvest season. For example: 2024: October 14  Initially celebrated on various dates from April to November, the date of Canadian Thanksgiving was officially set to the <b>second</b> Monday of <b>October</b> by a proclamation of parliament in 1957. The decision was made to distinguish the celebrations from the solemn observance of Remembrance Day in November.  Thanksgiving Day in Canada has been a holiday on the second <b>Monday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b> since 1957. It is a chance for people to give thanks for a good harvest and other fortunes in the past year. Thanksgiving Day in Canada is a time for family and food.  Thanksgiving was first observed as an annual event in Canada on <b>6</b> <b>November</b> <b>1879</b>. The date for each of the following years, as well as a unifying theme for which to give thanks (usually concerning the harvest, though anniversaries related to the British monarchy were also common), was determined annually by Parliament.  Today Canadian Thanksgiving is held on the second <b>Monday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b> every year, or at least it has been since Canadian Parliament declared it so on January <b>31</b>, 1957. Before this, Thanksgiving in Canada had been held sporadically, often coinciding with other major events and anniversaries.  Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated on various dates <b>in</b> <b>October</b> and <b>November</b> in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines.  We&#39;ll start with the biggie: when is Canadian Thanksgiving, anyway? Unlike Thanksgiving, which always falls on the fourth Thursday of November no matter the date, Canada&#39;s version occurs on the <b>second</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> <b>October</b>&mdash;<b>which</b> is <b>October</b> <b>9</b> in <b>2023</b>.  On January 31, 1957, the Governor General of <b>Canada</b> Vincent Massey issued a proclamation, and the second Monday in October is officially declared as <b>Thanksgiving Day</b>. So 11 th November was set as Remembrance <b>Day</b> thereafter. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving quotes for bday. Batman thanksgiving solomon grundy. Thanksgiving restaurants sacramento.
