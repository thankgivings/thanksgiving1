        <h2><strong>What stores are open thanksgiving monday hamilton Dollar tree thanksgiving deals</strong></h2>
        <p>Chuseok (추석) &ndash; otherwise known as Hangawi (한가위) by Koreans or as &ldquo;Korean Thanksgiving&rdquo; by Westerners &ndash; is one of the most significant public holidays in Korea, together with Seollal or the Korean New Year (설날).  Chuseok (<b>추석</b>), also known as Hangawi (한가위), is typically considered &ldquo;Korean Thanksgiving.&rdquo; It is one of the two biggest holidays in Korea and is celebrated according to the lunar calendar, so the exact dates differ from year to year. This year it is a glorious 5-day holiday, September 14 ~ September 18, 2024, and we are all very excited about it.  Chuseok, also known as Korean <b>Thanksgiving</b>, is one of South <b>Korea</b>&rsquo;s most cherished and significant holidays. If you&rsquo;re planning a visit to <b>Seoul </b>during Chuseok, quite some places will be closed as Koreans visit their families &ndash; similar to our Christmas holidays..  Chuseok (추석), also known as Hangawi, marks a zenith in the Korean calendar, rivaling only the lunar New Year in its cultural significance. Often likened to Thanksgiving, this festival is observed on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month, typically aligning with September or October by the Gregorian reckoning.  Another dine in option would be Hearth in <b>Seoul</b>. They have Thanksgiving dinners for 2, from 28th to 1st of December. Their course menu includes Turkey, ciabatta bread, feta cheese salad, apple walnut stuffing, classic lasagne, pecan pie and a complimentary drink.  Known as Korean <b>Thanksgiving </b>internationally, Chuseok is a joyful holiday for Koreans. Let&rsquo;s find out all you need to know about the Korean <b>Thanksgiving</b>. What Is Chuseok? What Does &ldquo;Chuseok&rdquo; Mean? When Is Chuseok? How to Say &ldquo;Happy Chuseok&rdquo; <b>in </b>Korean? What Are Chuseok Traditions? What Is Popular Chuseok Food?  We are celebrating Chuseok, one of the most important holidays on the Korean calendar and known as Korean <b>Thanksgiving </b>Day. <b>In </b>this piece, we&rsquo;ll walk you through the dazzling kaleidoscope that is this extraordinary festival.  Chuseok, also referred to as the Korean <b>Thanksgiving </b>Day, is a traditional harvest festival that venerates the plentiful autumn harvest and expresses appreciation to ancestors. This three-day event highlights the enduring customs and principles of Korean culture.  In 2024, Korean Thanksgiving or Chuseok, lands on <b>Tuesday</b>, September <b>17th</b>. The public holiday dates for this year are Monday, September 16th to Wednesday, September 18th, meaning everyone will have a 5 day weekend. You can enjoy traditional performances if you stay in Seoul during Chuseok. </p>        <p>Open fast food places on thanksgiving.
