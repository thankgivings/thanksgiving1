        <h2><strong>Wishes you have a happy thanksgiving Disney vero beach resort thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>I have a friend coming over from OOS for the first half of thanksgiving <b>break</b> and I don&#39;t have a <b>parking</b> spot in my building he could park at. Any possible places he could park for a few days?  You must complete the <b>break</b> housing contract and will be charged the <b>break</b> housing rate for each night. Students must apply for fall <b>break</b> housing by 8 a.m. on November 11. After 10 a.m., students should visit the ISR, PAR or Snyder front desks to complete a break housing contract.  I seem to remember <b>parking</b> with impunity (outright impunity!) during Thanksgiving <b>break</b> in the past, but this year I just didn&#39;t have the nerve. And for those who don&#39;t know, most lot <b>parking</b> during the winter months starts at 4 pm, not 5.  <b>University</b> <b>Parking</b> Facilities &ndash; All <b>University</b> of <b>Illinois</b> <b>Urbana</b>-<b>Champaign</b> campus administered facilities including <b>parking</b> structures, parking decks, parking lots, university-owned streets, alleys, service access roads, and drives where parking is permitted or prohibited.  Students who stay may have limited access to <b>UIUC</b> buildings as some are closed. Since there are 50,000 students, many of whom are from out of state, and since UIUC staff work through Thanksgiving <b>break</b>, there are many people in and around campus.  Unused gift days are not paid out at the time of termination and do not roll over into the next fiscal year. For other questions related to gift days, contact Labor and Employee Relations at 333-3105. Employees have two Floating Holidays that can be used any time from July 1, 2024, until June 30, 2025.  Visitor <b>parking</b> is available at meters on university streets and drives and in designated campus lots and <b>parking</b> garages. Visitors must pay the established meter fee. A vehicle displaying a valid state accessibility placard or disability plate may park at designated public accessible spaces or any meter while paying the appropriate meter fee.  Contact your resident advisor (RA) or email <b>gud</b>-<b>halls@illinois</b>.<b>edu</b>. Moving Out and Not Returning after Winter Break? If you are not returning for the spring 2025 semester, you must request cancellation of the housing contract by submitting the request online .  The city of Champaign and Urbana have free parking zones, you could look it up.
