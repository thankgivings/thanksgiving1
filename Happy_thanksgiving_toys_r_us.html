        <p>This <b>year</b>&#39;<b>s</b> <b>parade</b> will feature appearances by Mickey and Minnie Mouse, and Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus; marching bands from across the nation, balloons, floats, performances, and fan favorites from music, stage, and screen. The <b>parade</b> is free to attend and open to the public.  Even Santa will be at the <b>parade</b>! There&#39;s no cost to parade-goers, but finding a great location to take in all the action requires some work. The best seats are in the grandstands, but availability is extremely limited and mostly reserved for sponsors and VIPs.  9 a.m.-3 p.m. &mdash; Eakins Oval between Kelly Drive and MLK Jr. Drive closed for <b>parade</b> rehearsals. 4 p.m. &mdash; Inner lanes of Benjamin Franklin Parkway, from 21st St. to 20th St. closed for site ...  Heated <b>seating</b> areas available for reservations include a fire pit lounges and small tables, each with their own minimum spend ranging from $250 to $600 and <b>seating</b> capacity of up to 12 people.  Why it matters: Philly&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>parade</b> is billed as the oldest in the country. It was canceled in 2020 &mdash; only the second time in history &mdash; due to the pandemic, before returning last year. Details: The three-hour event will feature dozens of floats, marching bands, dance groups, performances, and the Mummers.  The turkey-filled holiday is almost here, and that means the annual Philadelphia <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Parade</b> will be in full swing this Thursday, Nov. 28. The event &mdash; which happens to be the oldest of its kind in the country &mdash; takes over the Ben Franklin Parkway, and is free and open to the public.  The oldest Thanksgiving Day parade in the nation, Philadelphia&rsquo;s <b>6abc</b> <b>Dunkin</b>&rsquo; Thanksgiving Day <b>Parade</b>, officially launches the holiday season with massive balloons, breathtaking floats and the highly anticipated arrival of a certain Mr. Claus.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Parade</b> begins early, will route through museum district. Philadelphia&#39;s historic <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> <b>parade</b>, now in its 105th year, will officially begin at 9 a.m. and will route through Philadelphia&#39;s museum district: Starts at 20th Street &amp; John F. Kennedy Boulevard; Eastbound on John F. Kennedy Boulevard toward 16th Street  The parade will be held on <b>Thursday</b>, <b>November</b> <b>28</b>, <b>2024</b>.
