        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving cards funny greeting Free turkey crafts thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>The United States holiday of Thanksgiving is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as <b>pilgrims</b>) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  The <b>pilgrims</b>&#39; story had already become a foundational myth of the United States by the 19th century when President Abraham Lincoln (served 1861-1865) decreed the 4th Thursday of November the national holiday of Thanksgiving, and since then, the above story is repeated with little change. The pilgrims were human beings, however, not characters ...  Americans are told the first Thanksgiving took place in 1621, when the <b>Pilgrim</b> settlers of Plymouth, Massachusetts, invited the Wampanoag to a harvest feast. The story goes the meal invite was to thank them for their help in planting crops, and that a warm friendship budded between the two people groups.  For American culture, the story of the <b>Pilgrims</b>, including their &ldquo;first Thanksgiving&rdquo; feast with the local Native Americans, has become the ruling creation narrative, celebrated each November along with turkey, pumpkin pie, and football games.  Four hundred years later, the so-called first <b>Thanksgiving </b>is undergoing a reassessment. Museums and historic sites in Plymouth and around the country are telling a more nuanced story about the...  In 1620, about 100 religious <b>Pilgrims</b> left England on the Mayflower for the &quot;New World&quot; and landed in modern-day southeastern Massachusetts, a region inhabited by the Wampanoag people.  Learn about the first encounter between the <b>Pilgrims</b> and Native Americans in 1621, their surprising relationship, and the reason a United States president created a holiday in honor of it. The...  Thanksgiving Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (<b>Pilgrims</b>) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  In the Fall of 1621, the <b>Pilgrims</b> famously shared a harvest feast with the Pokanokets; the meal is now considered the basis for the Thanksgiving holiday. It took place over three days between... </p>        <p>What is thank god you re here. Thanksgiving dinner do ahead.
