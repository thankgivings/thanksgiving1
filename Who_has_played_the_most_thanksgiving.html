        <h2><strong>Who has played the most thanksgiving Southern style menu board for thanksgiving dinner</strong></h2>
        <p>When you hear about the Pilgrims and &ldquo;the <b>Indians</b>&rdquo; harmoniously sharing the &ldquo;<b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; meal in 1621, the <b>Indians</b> referred to so generically are the ancestors of the contemporary members of the Wampanoag <b>Nation</b>.  The true history of Thanksgiving begins with the Indians. The <b>Haudenosaunee</b> <b>nations</b>&mdash;the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Mohawk, and Tuscarora&mdash;traditionally open and close every important gathering with a version of the Ohenten Kariwatekwen, often called the Haudenosaunee Thanksgiving Address.  The <b>Mashpee</b> Wampanoag first encountered the Pilgrims who arrived on the Mayflower ship in 1620. They say much is missing from the often-told Thanksgiving story.  Due to his knowledge of English, the Pilgrims made Squanto an interpreter and emissary between the English and Wampanoag Confederacy. What really happened at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621? The...  Since 1970, many native people have gathered at the statue of Massasoit in Plymouth, Massachusetts, each <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day to remember their ancestors and the strength of the Wampanoag. In the...  The true history of Thanksgiving begins with the <b>Indians</b>. The Thanksgiving story deeply rooted in America&rsquo;s school curriculum frames the Pilgrims as the main characters and reduces the Wampanoag...  <b>Squanto</b>, a local Indian who had been kidnapped and taken to England nearly a decade before, served as an interpreter with the local tribes. Squanto taught the Pilgrims to fertilize the soil with dried fish remains to produce a stellar corn crop.  The noise surprised ancestors of the modern-day Wampanoag <b>Nation</b>. So, they went to investigate. This is how native people came to be present at the first Thanksgiving, Peters said.  <b>In </b>1620, about 100 religious Pilgrims left England on <b>the </b>Mayflower for <b>the </b>&quot;New World&quot; and landed <b>in </b>modern-day southeastern Massachusetts, a region inhabited by <b>the </b>Wampanoag people. </p>        <p>Does europe recognize thanksgiving.
