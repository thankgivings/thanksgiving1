        <p>But the general consensus is that there is <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> <b>Jewish</b> law with eating turkey and observing the other traditions around Thanksgiving provided they aren&rsquo;t construed as obligations, which would imply a kind of religious status.  We know that bringing a <b>thanksgiving</b> offering is not obligatory; it is a voluntary heartfelt gesture. The priests and the courts could never demand that someone bring a todah. How can Rashi then imply that specific cases require one to offer an animal as evidence of his thanks?  It turns out that thanksgiving (or giving thanks) is very Jewish. In fact, the very term Jew (Yehudi) is directly linked to the Hebrew word hoda&rsquo;ah, which means &ldquo;thanks.&rdquo; Here are seven classic Jewish ways to express your gratitude: 1. Todah <b>Rabah</b>.  May we each know the goodness of the day, and as we sit to eat our turkey (which in modern <b>Hebrew</b> is the same word &ndash; hodu), may we know just how good is our bounty, and how great is our blessing. <b>Happy</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> and Todah Rabbah (Many thanks).  While we typically don&rsquo;t think of <b>Thanksgiving</b> as a particularly Jewish day, it has the potential to be the most Jewish of all the secular holidays. With its focus on gathering as a community, giving thanks, and being mindful, Thanksgiving is infused with central Jewish values.  Giving thanks to God for the bounty of the earth is a very <b>Jewish</b> thing to do, as is spending some time during the meal talking about the things we are grateful for in our lives. Time spent with family and friends reflect the <b>Jewish</b> values of family and community.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is perhaps the perfect intersection of our two great religious traditions in Judaism and Christianity. Unlike Christmas vs. Chanukah or Easter vs. Passover, where there are clear theological conflicts and a myriad of real-life complications, Thanksgiving is conflict-free (unless you talk politics, in which case you&rsquo;ll probably ...  <b>Happy</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>! For many, Thanksgiving gathers us with family and friends, inviting us to reflect gratefully on our blessings . For others, Thanksgiving can be a day of quiet despair and even shame for those who don&rsquo;t feel grateful and festive.  If we only take the time to say a few words of <b>thanksgiving</b> to God, whether for bringing the family together or for giving us the food on our plates, we can make <b>Thanksgiving</b> have <b>Jewish</b> meaning. </p>        <p>Best restaurants in los angeles for thanksgiving.
