        <p>Bonus Savvy <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Etiquette</b> <b>Rules</b> Plan in advance for others to take leftovers home. If you&rsquo;re a guest who brought food to the meal, and you leave early, you can take your container, but leave all the extra food with the host in case someone wants seconds, or thirds.  6 <b>Etiquette</b> Mistakes You Might Be Making at Thanksgiving 1. Bringing your own (large) <b>leftover</b> containers. We get it, you want leftovers. But unless your host has suggested that you should bring your own containers for any extras, it&#39;s best to leave your Pyrex at home.  Here are five common <b>etiquette</b> questions surrounding <b>leftovers</b> answered. 1. If you contribute a dish to a Friendsgiving, can you take your own <b>leftovers</b> home? No. That green bean casserole you brought was a gift to the host and everyone who is attending the Friendsgiving. You should not expect to bring any <b>leftovers</b> home. 2.  If you&#39;re FRYING your <b>turkey</b>, make sure you thaw it first to avoid turning a Butterball into a FIREBALL. The Consumer Product Safety Commission&#39;s no-nonsense frozen <b>turkey</b> PSA from last year is going viral again.  From cooking stress to tense conversations to full-on blowouts, many situations can derail a <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner. But there are ways to keep things peaceful and light, as well. We asked <b>etiquette</b> experts to share some common rude behaviors at big holiday gatherings like <b>Thanksgiving</b>, and advice for avoiding them. </p>        <p>Raintree thanksgiving menu.
