        <h2><strong>Classic thanksgiving centerpiece from you flowers Is southpoint mall open on thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Breaking down the historically one-sided narrative about <b>Thanksgiving</b> in the US has been a decades-long effort, led by historians and Indigenous communities. Facing History takes a look at that legacy.  All of the <b>speeches</b> will likely mention the pandemic because Indigenous communities in the U.S. have been disproportionately impacted, she says. This <b>Thanksgiving</b>, Kisha James asks non-Native...  Long before the arrival of the Pilgrims, the Wampanoag held frequent <b>Thanksgiving</b>-<b>like</b> <b>celebrations</b>, giving thanks in the form of feasts and ceremonial games. Exposed to new diseases, the ...  In <b>1970</b>, <b>activist</b> <b>Wamsutta</b> <b>James</b> was forbidden from giving a fiery speech that reframed Thanksgiving from the Native American perspective. He gave it anyway and launched a movement that advocated a different point of view for this holiday.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> was not a happy time for him or other Wampanoag people because it represents a celebration of the invasion and all the devastation that would follow for Indigenous people in the...  National <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day observances are largely filled with myths and misinformation. Popular American folklore suggests the &ldquo;first Thanksgiving&rdquo; was an idyllic feast. This myth, which ignores the fact that the feast was never repeated and that Thanksgiving is an invented holiday, runs contrary to many realities.  The Mashpee Wampanoag first encountered the Pilgrims who arrived on the Mayflower ship in 1620. They say much is missing from the often-told <b>Thanksgiving</b> story.  That silencing of a strong and honest Native voice led to the convening of the National Day of Mourning. The following is the text of 1970 <b>speech</b> by <b>Wampsutta</b>, an Aquinnah Wampanoag elder and Native American activist. I speak to you as a man -- a Wampanoag Man.  The existence of that meal, which held little importance to either the Pilgrims or the <b>Wampanoag</b>, is the basis of the <b>Thanksgiving</b> myth. The myth, re-told in school Thanksgiving pageants and TV shows, is not accurate and is harmful to Native people, especially to the Wampanoag. </p>        <p>Nontradional thanksgiving dinner.
