        <h2><strong>Pete the cat thanksgiving crafts Cauliflower dish for thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Here&rsquo;s a look at <b>Thanksgiving</b> history and evolution from 1919 until now. The first Thanksgiving meal was prepared 100% by women (only four of them, to be exact). Fast-forward to 1919, Congress had just passed 19th amendment granting women the right to vote. It would be ratified the following year.  The first <b>Thanksgiving</b> wasn&rsquo;t one big feast but actually went on for a full week. Some days everyone would eat together and on other days they would eat separately. Modern <b>Thanksgiving</b> Meal. It wasn&rsquo;t until the 19th century that what we think of as the typical Thanksgiving meal was started.  Taking a closer look at the history behind the modern <b>Thanksgiving</b>. MINNESOTA &ndash; For some, <b>Thanksgiving</b> continues to be an important day of the year filled with many time&ndash;honored family...  Modern <b>Thanksgiving</b> is essentially a celebration of 4 F&rsquo;s &mdash; family, friends, football and food, which are all similar themes to those of the &ldquo;first Thanksgiving&rdquo; in 1621.  When most Americans think about <b>Thanksgiving</b> today, they tend to think about football, turkey, &quot;pilgrims,&quot; &quot;Indian corn,&quot; and Native Americans, more or less in that order. But <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>is</b> bigger than all that, and much older, too. Let&#39;s start with the parts of the story that seem to go together: turkeys, &quot;pilgrims,&quot; corn, and Native Americans.  In this lesson students compare the Pilgrims&#39; &quot;First <b>Thanksgiving</b>&quot; in 1621 to a modern-day Thanksgiving celebration. They use a Venn diagram to help them organize their thoughts and research. Younger students might focus on the foods that were part of the feast the Pilgrims and Wampanoags shared.  Here are some examples of how that long-ago celebration differed from our modern perception of it: Thanksgiving <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>originate</b> <b>with</b> the <b>Pilgrims</b>; it was an ancient historical custom...  Originally an English tradition, days of <b>thanksgiving</b> typically were marked by religious services to give thanks to God, or to celebrate a bountiful harvest. The first recorded religious...  In 1919, many families were spending their first <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner together since World War I.
