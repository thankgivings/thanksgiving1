        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving day activities for middle school students Philadelphia thanksgiving parade online</strong></h2>
        <p>It&rsquo;s very, very likely the Pilgrims and <b>Wampanoag</b> <b>ate</b> <b>corn</b> for the first Thanksgiving&mdash;but not the frozen kind that you heat up in the microwave (obviously). Nor was it the boiled kind, the cobbed kind, the pudding kind, or the cornbread kind with little bits of sausage in it that only your great-aunt Suzie knows how to make.  For most people, <b>enjoying</b> <b>turkey</b>, <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> for Thanksgiving is as traditional and American as, well, <b>apple</b> <b>pie</b>. But how did the Pilgrims...  <b>What Did</b> the <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>Eat</b> on the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? Many dishes served during modern <b>Thanksgiving</b> meals were not present <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>.

What Did the Pilgrims Eat? Today, we <b>eat</b> <b>turkey</b>, <b>stuffing</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, and <b>vegetables</b> as the base feast for our Thanksgivings. We also tend to have lots of pies and bread.  There are only two surviving documents that reference the original <b>Thanksgiving</b> harvest meal. They describe a <b>feast</b> of freshly killed deer, assorted wildfowl, a bounty of cod and bass, and flint, a native variety of corn harvested by the Native Americans, which was eaten as corn bread and porridge.  Massasoit sent some of his own men to hunt deer for the <b>feast</b> and for three days, the English and native men, women, and children ate together. The meal consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and... </p>        <p>Thank god riles. Halftime show thanksgiving detroit. Grocery stores open victoria day durham region.
