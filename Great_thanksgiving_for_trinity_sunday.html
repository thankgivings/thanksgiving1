        <h2><strong>Great thanksgiving for trinity sunday Thanksgiving day sweet potato recipe</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is popularly modeled on a romanticized view of the Pilgrims of Plimouth Colony in Massachusetts in the 1620s. The story tends to go that they held a feast to thank both the Native Americans who had helped them survive through the winter and God whom they believed had led them to the New World.  The cornucopia has long been a <b>symbol</b> of the <b>Thanksgiving</b> season &mdash; a large (often wicker) horn overflowing with fruits and vegetables and grains. It&rsquo;s also known as the horn of plenty, and for good reason. The word cornucopia comes from the Latin cornu &ldquo;horn&rdquo; (also the source of unicorn) and copiae &ldquo;abundance.&rdquo;  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a holiday that has changed a great deal over the course of <b>American</b> history. Its origins are wrapped up in the colonial founding story of our country: that of English Pilgrims landing at Plymouth Rock and the &ldquo;First <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&rdquo; The reality, however, is more complicated. Tracing the history of November&rsquo;s big holiday backward&hellip;  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Table. <b>Symbol</b> of Togetherness: The <b>Thanksgiving</b> table represents more than just a place to eat; it symbolizes family, unity, and shared gratitude. Traditional Foods and Decor: The table is often adorned with classic <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>symbols</b>, such as pumpkins, gourds, and candles, enhancing the spirit of the season.  Being that <b>Thanksgiving</b> originated from Native <b>American</b> harvest celebrations, it&rsquo;s no surprise this Greek <b>symbol</b> of the harvest found its way into <b>Thanksgiving symbols</b>. Traditionally, the cornucopia was a goat&rsquo;s horn given to the God Zeus as a gift.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is a national holiday in the United States, and, in 2024, falls on Thursday, November 28. In 1621, the Plymouth colonists from England and the Native <b>American</b> Wampanoag people ...  Turkey, corn (or maize), pumpkins and cranberry sauce are <b>symbols</b> which represent the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>. These <b>symbols</b> are frequently seen on holiday decorations and greeting cards. The use of corn meant the survival of the colonies. Flint corn is often used as a table or door decoration represents the harvest and the fall season.  It&rsquo;s no surprise that <b>Thanksgiving</b>, a holiday dedicated to practicing gratitude, is in November, because November is National Gratitude Month..
