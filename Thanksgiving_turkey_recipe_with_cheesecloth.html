        <p><b>On May</b> <b>26</b>, <b>1637</b>, two hours before dawn, the Puritans and their Native allies marched on the Pequot village at Mystic, slaughtering all but a handful of its inhabitants.  On May 26, <b>1637</b>, near the present-day Mystic River in Connecticut, while their warriors were away, an estimated 400 to 700 Pequot women, children, and old men were massacred and burned by...  The next day, John Winthrop (1588-1649), the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony <b>declared</b> &ldquo;A Day Of <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; because 700 unarmed men, women and children had been murdered. Cheered by their &ldquo;victory&rdquo;, the brave colonists and their Indian allies attacked village after village.  The <b>Pequot</b> Massacre, as it is known, took place on May 26, 1637, and was the coup-de-grace that capped nearly four years of skirmishes between the Pequot Nation &mdash; a tribe of approximately...  Led by Captain John Mason <b>on May</b> <b>26</b>, <b>1637</b>, in Mystic, CT, an attack resulted in the burning and killing of over four hundred men, women and children after Mason set fire to their village near the Mystic River. Some members were able to flee and joined tribes in New Netherlands, now called New York.  The Mystic massacre &ndash; also known as the Pequot massacre and the Battle of Mystic Fort &ndash; took place <b>on May 26</b>, <b>1637 </b>during the Pequot War, when a force from the Connecticut Colony under Captain John Mason and their Narragansett and Mohegan allies set fire to the Pequot Fort near the Mystic River.  On May 26, 1637 a force of Puritans attacked <b>about</b> 700 <b>Pequot</b> People near the mouth of the Mystic River at Groton, Connecticut. The Pequots had gathered for their Annual Green Corn Dance. During the gathering they were surrounded and attacked by the English and the Dutch.  The outcome was bloody beyond even the most sordid Puritan expec&shy;tations. Two hours before dawn on Friday, <b>May</b> <b>26</b>, <b>1637</b>, the combined Connecticut and Indian forces reached a ford in the Mystic River, stopped to pray, and then proceeded southward to execute their bloody work.  The next day the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony <b>declared</b> &ldquo;A Day Of <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; because 700 unarmed men, women and children had been murdered. Cheered by their &ldquo;victory&rdquo;, the brave colonists and their Indian allies attacked village after village. </p>        <p>Volunteer for thanksgiving dallas 2024.
