Post Communion <b>Lord</b> <b>of the harvest</b>, with joy we have offered <b>thanksgiving</b> for your love in creation and have shared in the bread and the wine of the kingdom: by your grace plant within us a reverence for all that ...  <b>Lord</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest</b>, grant that we wholesome grain and pure may be. and forgive us our trespasses, as we forg 4.Even so, Lord, quickly come, to thy final harvest-home; gather thou thy people in, For thine is the kingdom, the power free from sorrow, free from sin; and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen there for ever purified in thy presence to abide:  It is a day for <b>harvest</b> celebration. Let us rejoice and be glad in it! &ldquo;When you have eaten and are satisfied, praise the <b>Lord</b> your God for the good land he has given you&rdquo; (Deut. 8:10). Welcome [This is a day of <b>thanksgiving</b>, a day we set aside to give thanks, expressing our gratitude for God&rsquo;s many blessings. As you walked in this ...  Last of all was the Feast of Tabernacles, when the fruits of the earth had been gathered in, and the people gave thanks and rejoiced before the <b>Lord</b> with &quot;the joy of <b>harvest</b>&quot; (Leviticus 23:40; Deuteronomy 16:13-17). This psalm is a song of thanksgiving to God for the harvest.  Top <b>Thanksgiving</b> Bible Verses. <b>Psalm</b> <b>107:1</b>: &quot;Oh give thanks to the <b>Lord</b>, for he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever!&quot; Psalm 7:17: &quot;I will give to the Lord the thanks due to his righteousness, and I will sing praise to the name of the Lord, the Most High.&quot;  You see, throughout the Bible, harvest is mentioned over and over again, but it&rsquo;s not just about food. <b>In</b> <b>Matthew</b> <b>9:37</b>-<b>38</b>, <b>Jesus</b> says, &ldquo;The harvest is great, but the workers are few. So pray to the Lord who is in charge of the harvest; ask him to send more workers into his fields.&rdquo;  The phrase translated as &ldquo;Lord of the harvest&rdquo; means &ldquo;<b>Master</b> of the yield&rdquo; or &ldquo;Chief of the harvest&rdquo; in the original language. <b>God</b> <b>Himself</b> is the Commander-in-chief of the harvest. He is infinitely concerned about the mission, with every aspect of its implementation under His sovereign control.  For <b>the</b> <b>Lord</b> <b>our</b> <b>God</b> shall come, and shall take his harvest home; From his field shall purge away all that doth offend, that day; Give his angels charge at last in the fire the tares to cast; But the fruitful ears to store, in the garner evermore. Then, the Church triumphant come, raise the song of harvest-home!  Lord of <b>the</b> <b>harvest</b>: hear our prayer 3. At this harvest time we thank you for the world we see around us; For the flowers, the trees and the animals. Bless all those who care for them, Lord.
