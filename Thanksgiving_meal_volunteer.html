        <p>Since the first <b>War</b> <b>Eagle</b>, there have been seven others throughout Auburn&#39;s history that have served as a symbol of the Auburn spirit and kept alive the legendary battle cry. For more...  &ldquo;<b>War</b> <b>Eagle</b>&rdquo; is Auburn&#39;s battle cry &mdash;not a mascot or nickname. The phrase has a long history and deep significance among the Auburn Family (e.g., students, alumni, fans) who use it to greet and identify with each other all over the world!  The last <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day meeting of Pittsfield and St. Joseph&#39;s Highs was in 1938. Holiday football had a short revival last <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day when the St. Mary&#39;s Golden Bears lost to the Providence Steam Rollers before a large crowd at Deming Park.  The most popular story is from 1892, when a Civil <b>War</b> veteran was at a game between Auburn and Georgia with his pet <b>eagle</b> he had found during the <b>war</b>. The bird was named Anvre and is now known as <b>War</b> <b>Eagle</b> I, the first of seven in school history, according to AuburnTigers.com.  A look at a history of Auburn University&#39;s <b>eagles</b> following the death of <b>War</b> <b>Eagle</b> VI on June 18. Here, Cheerleaders &quot;<b>Happy</b>&quot; Davis and &quot;Bull&quot; Stiers are shown with Auburn&#39;s first eagle in...  Here are seven things you probably didn&rsquo;t know about <b>Thanksgiving</b> and the military: 1. The first nationally recognized <b>Thanksgiving</b> wasn&rsquo;t observed by the military. Blame resources. In October...  As the nation was enduring its great Civil <b>War</b>, Abraham Lincoln believed that giving thanks for our nation was in order. He went on to write: &ldquo;Needful diversions of wealth and of strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defense have not arrested the plow, the shuttle, or the ship; the ax has enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal ...  Cheerleaders DeWit Stier and Harry &quot;<b>Happy</b>&quot; Davis helped care for the new <b>eagle</b>. It was put in a strong wire enclosure and taken to the Auburn football game against the University of South Carolina in Columbus, Georgia on <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day. Auburn, having not won a Southern Conference game in four seasons, was anticipated to lose.  <b>War</b> <b>Eagle</b> <b>is</b> a greeting or salutation among the Auburn Family (e.g., students, alumni, fans). It is also the title of the university&#39;s fight song and the name of the university&#39;s golden eagle. The widespread use of &quot;War Eagle&quot; by Auburn devotees has often led to outside confusion as to Auburn&#39;s official mascot. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving miss you ecards.
