I cry <b>for those</b> of us left behind, for the lonely <b>ones</b> with hollows in our hearts. I ask You to comfort us, give peace, restore hope, and lavish us with love, family, and belonging. In the depths of <b>loss</b>, meet us with Yourself.

Though our pain is deep, we are grateful for the time we had with <b>those</b> we <b>loved</b>, and we thank you for the cherished memories we hold close.  Help us to remember that although we are separated for a time, we will all rejoice <b>one</b> day when we stand together in Your presence. Thank You that the brief night of weeping will pass very quickly, and we will all be rejoicing in Your presence on that glorious morning when we will all be reunited in the hope that is set before us.  Loving Father fill the empty places in our hearts and this empty place at our table with Your everlasting love. Teach us to savor the moments we have with <b>one</b> another, to remember what we have <b>lost</b>, but also to look forward to the great union in heaven. In Jesus, we <b>pray</b>.  The <b>loss</b> of <b>a loved</b> <b>one</b> is an experience that no <b>one</b> can fully prepare for, whether it arrives suddenly, like a thunderclap, or unfolds gradually, allowing time to brace for the inevitable. &amp;amp ...  Psalm 34:18 &ldquo;The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.&rdquo; 4. Thanksgiving <b>Prayer</b> For Departed Souls.
