        <h2><strong>Nutrition facts about thanksgiving food Thanksgiving poems for shared reading</strong></h2>
        <p>Let us strive to be grateful to God and thank Him many times during the <b>day</b>, but in order to do so, let us also ask for the virtue of humility as well. We need to be more humble, for humility leads one to acknowledge that all we have and all that we are comes from God.  <b>Homily</b> <b>for. Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b>. Preached by Fr. Brendan Freeman [Scripture Readings: Sir 50:22-24; Col 3:12-17; Lk 17:11-19] Today&rsquo;s celebration is an example of a practice the Church has used from earliest times, incorporating a civil or pagan festival into the liturgical calendar.  Every time we come to <b>Mass</b>, we unite ourselves in thanksgiving with the sacrifice of Jesus to his Father. As we give thanks to God, united with Jesus in his sacrifice during this Eucharist, we remember those who are not doing as well as we are.  The Readings for the Mass for Thanksgiving call us <b>to</b> <b>gratitude</b>. Jesus, in His Sacred humanity shows us how to live a life of gratitude and, through the gift of Himself - makes it all possible.  this Eucharistic celebration to start this <b>day</b> on which our nation pauses to give thanks to God for the many blessings that He has bestowed upon us over this past year.  <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> not just for the good but &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; for all aspects of life. &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; for each and every event, friendship and love of our existence. And &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; not just to each other and for our country...but &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to God without whom there would be no blessings.  In the Holy <b>Mass</b> we offer the sacrifice of Jesus to our Heavenly Father as an act of <b>thanksgiving</b>, and surrender our lives on the altar with repentant hearts, presenting our needs and asking for God&rsquo;s blessings. Life message: Let us be thankful and let us learn to express our thanks daily.  To listen to an audio recording of today&rsquo;s <b>homily</b>, please click here: The following text guided the preached homily: The crucial difference in the grateful leper. Today as we celebrate our national feast of Thanksgiving, the Church has us ponder in the Gospel the story of the ten lepers.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> Readings, Suggested <b>Homily</b> Notes, and Prayers of the Faithful Readings Reading 1 Sir 50:22-24 And now, bless the God of all, who has done wondrous things on earth; Who fosters people&#39;s growth from their mother&#39;s womb, and fashions them according to his will!
