The real history of <b>Thanksgiving</b> isn&#39;t the rosy <b>story</b> you learned as a kid. This is what really happened and why we need to remember.  <b>In </b>1620, about 100 religious Pilgrims left England on <b>the </b>Mayflower for <b>the </b>&quot;New World&quot; and landed <b>in </b>modern-day southeastern Massachusetts, a region inhabited by <b>the </b>Wampanoag people. </p>        <p>Humility at thanksgiving. <i>Tru fit hours thanksgiving</i>.
