        <p>What Was on the Menu at the First Thanksgiving? Traditional Thanksgiving dinner includes turkey, stuffing and mashed potatoes but the First Thanksgiving likely included wildfowl, corn, <b>porridge</b>...  So what <b>foods</b> were served at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  Massasoit sent some of his own men to hunt deer for the <b>feast</b> and for three days, the English and native men, women, and children ate together. The meal consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and...  The first Thanksgiving in 1621 was a 3-day harvest celebration hosted by the Pilgrims and Wampanoag Native Americans in Plymouth Colony, Massachusetts. Historical records indicate that the menu likely <b>included</b> <b>corn</b>, <b>berries</b>, <b>waterfowl</b>, <b>deer</b>, <b>seafood</b>, <b>and</b> <b>pumpkin</b> among other local ingredients.  During this day, people from the US celebrate and give thanks for what they have by feasting usually with <b>roast</b> <b>turkey</b>, <b>stuffing</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie</b>.  In 1621, pilgrims <b>and</b> <b>Wampanoag</b> <b>Indians</b> shared the feast over the course of three days that is now known as the First Thanksgiving. In depictions of this sharing of food and traditions, we often see many foods we are familiar with. But, is this really accurate?  From <b>seafood</b> to carrots, historians report that what was eaten at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years.  To put it simply, the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> wasn&rsquo;t some grand event planned months in advance. The Pilgrims had just survived a brutal winter and a difficult harvest.  Geese, duck, and swan satiated the roughly 140 attendees of the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>, but that doesn&#39;t mean that petite fowl like pigeons were excluded. Edward Winslow&#39;s writing of the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>gives</b> some telling information about the colonists&#39; preparation for the three-day <b>feast</b>. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving harry potter.
