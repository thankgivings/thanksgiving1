        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving meals greensboro nc Things to do on thanksgiving day san francisco</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  Read about <b>Thanksgiving</b> in USA in 2024. <b>Thanksgiving</b> is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November in the United <b>States</b> of America. The tradition dates back to 1621, when the pilgrims gave thanks for their first bountiful harvest in Plymouth Rock.  The United <b>States</b> holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native <b>Americans</b> of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  The United States celebrates Thanksgiving as a national holiday on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> in <b>November</b>. In 2024, Thanksgiving will be observed on Thursday, November 28. Thanksgiving has been held on the fourth Thursday in November since 1941, which means that the date of the holiday shifts each year.  This week the U.S. celebrates the holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which has been an official national holiday since President Abraham Lincoln, after a campaign by magazine editor Sarah Josepha Hale, declared it as such in 1863.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is a day for people in the US to give thanks for what they have. Families and friends get together for a meal, which traditionally includes a roast turkey, stuffing, potatoes, vegetables, cranberry sauce, gravy, and pumpkin pie.  Most <b>Americans</b> are familiar with the Pilgrim&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Feast of 1621, but few realize that it was not the first festival of its kind in North America. Long before Europeans set foot in the Americas, native peoples sought to insure a good harvest with dances and rituals such as the Green Corn Dance of the Cherokees.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is celebrated in the country in large part due to the nation&#39;s founding as a colony of the <b>American</b> Colonization Society in 1821 by former slaves and free people of color from the United <b>States</b>. However, the Liberian celebration of the holiday is notably different from the <b>American</b> celebration.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is a national holiday in the United <b>States</b>, and, in 2024, falls on Thursday, November 28. In 1621, the Plymouth colonists from England and the Native <b>American</b> Wampanoag... </p>        <p>Free kindergarten thanksgiving crafts. Open on thanksgiving monday toronto.
