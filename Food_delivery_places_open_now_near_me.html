        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, observed in 2024 on Thursday, November 28, honors a 1621 feast between Plymouth colonists and the Wampanoag people.  The first Thanksgiving was a <b>harvest</b> celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first Thanksgiving. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written.  From the landing on Plymouth Rock to the harmonious feast with the native Wampanoags, the story about the <b>Pilgrims</b> &mdash; and by extension, the story of <b>Thanksgiving</b> &mdash; is rife with myth and inaccuracy.  The <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoag shared a harvest feast, but it didn&#39;t happen the way you were likely taught in school. Every November, Americans gather around the table to celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> in ...  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a U.S. holiday celebrated each year at the end of November. Learn about the history of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, facts about the Mayflower and the <b>Pilgrims</b>, and more.  For American culture, the story of the <b>Pilgrims</b>, including their &ldquo;first <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; feast with the local Native Americans, has become the ruling creation narrative, celebrated each November along with turkey, pumpkin pie, and football games.  Learn about the first encounter between the <b>Pilgrims</b> and Native Americans in 1621, their surprising relationship, and the reason a United States president created a holiday in honor of it. The...  The <b>Pilgrims</b> were people who traveled from England to the Netherlands and then to New England by the beginning of the 17 th century. They are nowadays easily related to <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day because, after the first harvest season in New England, they gave thanks to God and to the natives who helped them survive, celebrating for three days.  The United States holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as <b>pilgrims</b>) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621. </p>        <p>Vegetables to cook for thanksgiving. 24 hour fitness thanksgiving times. <a href="./508.html">Vacation in florida during thanksgiving</a>.
