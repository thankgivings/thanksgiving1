According to the Texas Society Daughters of the American Colonists, the very first thanksgiving was observed by Spanish <b>explorer</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>Vasquez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Coronado</b>. Accompanied by 1,500 men in...  Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in <b>October</b> <b>and</b> November in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  <b>On</b> <b>September</b> <b>28</b>, <b>1789</b>, just before leaving for recess, the first Federal Congress passed a resolution asking that the President of the United States recommend to the nation a day of thanksgiving.  It is intended to celebrate the blessings of the past year. <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day became an <b>official</b> U.S. holiday in 1863, and in 1942 the federal government designated the fourth Thursday in November as <b>Thanksgiving</b>. A traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal consists of turkey, cranberries, bread stuffing, and pumpkin pie, among other dishes.  The First Thanksgiving is dated <b>to</b> <b>1621</b>. When did Thanksgiving become an American holiday? Thanksgiving became an American holiday in 1863 but was not observed in every state until after 1963. Why do Native Americans object to Thanksgiving?  How did Thanksgiving start? Colonists in New England and Canada regularly observed &ldquo;thanksgivings,&rdquo; days of prayer for such blessings as safe journeys, military victories, or abundant harvests. Americans model their holiday on a <b>1621</b> harvest feast shared between the Wampanoag people and the English colonists known as Pilgrims .  In <b>1941</b>, a Congressional Joint Resolution officially set the fourth Thursday of November as a national holiday for Thanksgiving. Today, Thanksgiving is a time when many families come together, and many churches are open for special services.  Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>of</b> <b>November</b>. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions. </p>        <p>Is stock market open tomorrow thanksgiving. <a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/thanksgiving1/722.html">Thanksgiving acrostic poem template free</a>. 1970s thanksgiving recipes.
