The America&#39;s Hometown Thanksgiving Parade is an annual parade held in <b>Plymouth</b>, Massachusetts.

For more details, see the lead item in this column. Singer-songwriter Caitlin Canty will perform at the Spire. Canty plays ...  Later in New England, religious thanksgiving services were declared by civil leaders such as Governor Bradford, who planned the <b>Plymouth</b> colony&#39;s thanksgiving celebration and feast in 1623. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Bradford issued a proclamation of Thanksgiving following victory in the Pequot War in the late 1630s to celebrate &quot;the bloody victory ...  The United States holiday of Thanksgiving is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of <b>Plymouth</b> Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving skit guys youtube.
