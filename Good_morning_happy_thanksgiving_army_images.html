        <h2><strong>Good morning happy thanksgiving army images Thanksgiving dinner 2024 alexandria va</strong></h2>
        <p>Taking my new found wisdom into account, my opinion of the &ldquo;best holiday of the year&rdquo; has changed from Christmas to <b>Thanksgiving</b>. My views, including favorite holiday, have changed because my focus on what&rsquo;s important has matured. Christmas is a kid&rsquo;s favorite holidays for really only one reason: presents.  There are different ways to try to understand <b>Thanksgiving</b> and <b>Christmas</b>. There is even a variety of ways to understand their meaning and significance by comparing and contrasting the two. But a better way perhaps is two see them from the eyes of a child.  <b>Essay</b> on <b>Compare</b> and <b>Contrast</b>: <b>Christmas</b> and <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Holidays</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> celebrated no matter religion, beliefs, or culture. Some are recognized more than others but none two are as highly recognized like the cherished Christmas and Thanksgiving holidays.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>holiday</b> that focuses on giving thanks to God and giving back to others. Christmas, on the other hand, is a religious holiday. It is a celebrated Christian holiday. Christmas is the day that God&rsquo;s son, Jesus, was born. Although Christmas is a religious holiday, the true meaning of Christmas tends to get lost.  <b>Compare</b> and <b>Contrast</b>: <b>Christmas</b> and <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Holidays</b> are always celebrated no matter religion, beliefs, or culture. Some are recognized more than others but none two are as highly recognized like the cherished Christmas and Thanksgiving holidays.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> and <b>Christmas</b> are two very prominent holidays for bringing out all the wonderful seasonal decorations. For Thanksgiving time you might see pumpkins arranged on the front lawns or a scarecrow propped up on a tree or even wreaths made out of the fallen leaves from trees.  As <b>Thanksgiving</b> lurks around the corner, and <b>Christmas</b> decorations are already sprouting about, the holiday season is approaching rapidly which raises the question: which of the two holidays are better, <b>Christmas</b> or <b>Thanksgiving</b>? To answer this as unbiased as possible, I will break down the facts to find out which holiday is objectively better.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> and <b>Christmas</b> are both holidays when people show lots of concern and compassion for others. Even though there are many similarities between the two, they also have lots of differences. Traditions and the seasons are two main areas that differ when comparing and contrasting.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> day celebrated as giving thanks for blessings brought throughout the year, it is also a time to celebrate the years harvest. Christmas is the celebration of the birth of Christ. Even though the holidays share many similarities, they also hold differences such as traditions, decorations, and the reason as to why we celebrate each. </p>        <p>Disney world holidays summer 2024. <a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/thanksgiving1/518.html">How much food to make thanksgiving</a>.
